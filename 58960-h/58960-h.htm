<p class='c005'>The present volume is the fourth work published by the Yale University
Press on the Anthony N. Brady Memorial Foundation, which was
established June 15, 1914, by members of the family of the late Anthony
N. Brady to enable the University to declare operative the agreement for
an alliance between the New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of
Medicine. In addition to the pledge of endowment for this purpose, the
donors erected for the University on the grounds of the Hospital a clinical
and pathological laboratory, and have since, through additional
gifts to supplement the income of the Memorial Foundation, made possible
the publication of this and other works by members of the faculty
of the School of Medicine at Yale.</p>
<p class='c006'>Our grateful acknowledgment is due the Staff of the New Haven
Hospital, especially the members of the Department of Medicine,
for their hearty co-operation and for the use of the clinical
notes. We also wish to thank the members of the Medical Corps
of the United States Army who were stationed at the Yale Army
Laboratory School while the work was in progress and who aided
in many ways:—Colonel Charles F. Craig, Captain R. A. Lambert,
Lieutenants C. A. McKinlay, Frederick Parker, Jr., Ellis
Kellert, Henry R. Muller, and J. H. Globus.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The epidemic of influenza, prevalent in Europe during the Great War, was watched
with interest everywhere, not only because of its military importance, but also because of
the danger of its spreading to other continents. The prediction that this would occur,
made months before its realization, was verified on an even larger scale than had been anticipated,
for in the autumn of 1918, this acute respiratory infection passed over the United
States like a huge wave, taking a tremendous toll in human lives; later smaller waves followed
leaving in their wake corresponding degrees of devastation. The first cases of the
disease appeared on the New England coast, and New Haven was among the cities to be
early invaded, though here the epidemic was somewhat less severe than in other cities along
the Atlantic Seaboard.</p>

<p class='c013'>Forewarned and alert to the danger, medical men spared no effort in studying the disease;
as a result, no malady, perhaps, has ever been investigated so intensively and from so
many different points of attack in an equal length of time. Proof of this appears in the
abundant literature issuing from every quarter. Among the various contributions to
this subject, many include the anatomical changes associated with the disease. In general,
however, these are brief; and although they serve their special purpose well, they have not
been elaborated sufficiently to close the chapter.</p>

<p class='c013'>During a period of about three months beginning with September 18, 1918, while the
epidemic raged and waned in New Haven, there were approximately eleven hundred cases
of the disease admitted to the New Haven Hospital. As is so often true, only the more
critically ill sought hospital care, and few, if any, patients affected by other respiratory infections
are included in these statistics. The mortality here, as elsewhere, was very high;
of two hundred eighty (280) cases that ended fatally, eighty-two (82) were investigated at
the post-mortem table. An attempt was made to make the studies very complete, and this
was favored since the headquarters of the Yale Army Laboratory School, under the command
of Colonel Charles F. Craig, were located at the Brady Laboratory where a large number
of men were being instructed in Pathology and Bacteriology. It was also fortunate
that competent illustrators were available who made a splendid series of water-colors and
drawings of the characteristic lesions, both gross and microscopic.</p>

<p class='c013'>The number of autopsied cases at the New Haven Hospital was augmented by a series
of acute fatalities from the same disease at the United States General Hospital No. 16,
at Allingtown, West Haven, where the anatomical studies were carried on by the same group
of men. The latter autopsies offered nothing new, but served to corroborate the conclusions
reached at the New Haven Hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'>The majority of the fatalities occurred in the acute stage of the disease, the anatomical
aspects of which have been elaborated more or less completely.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Other cases survived for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a longer period and in these, anatomical changes existed, which, as will appear later, were
prognosticated from the acute lesions. Moreover, these findings suggested that certain
progressive anatomical changes occur even when the disease runs a much less severe clinical
course; for example, in cases where respiratory symptoms persist for a long period before
they are brought to a fatal conclusion.</p>

<p class='c013'>History, too, suggests such a chain of events; namely, in the record of the delayed crop
of respiratory disorders that followed the harvest of the epidemic of ’90.</p>

<p class='c013'>Previous studies of experimental pneumonia in normal and aplastic animals by one of
the authors (160) give a background for the interpretation of the histology of some phases
of this disease, but more important are the studies of the respiratory inflammatory processes
initiated by the inhalation of toxic gases. This subject, introduced into human Pathology
with the use of poisonous gases in modern warfare, necessitated elaborate investigations
which have just been concluded (159).</p>

<p class='c013'>The pathology produced by the inhalation of these poisonous vapors is analogous to
that found in influenzal pneumonia. This is said with a full comprehension of the criticism
that may follow such a statement, and with the knowledge that a similar analogy has been
drawn between influenzal and plague pneumonia (Symmers, 141). It is, however, a criticism
that is welcomed and which will be met in the body of the paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the reasons just cited, it has seemed desirable to contribute to the Pathology of
various phases of influenzal pneumonia and to attempt to correlate this with other types of
acute respiratory inflammation, in the hope that the prognostications which suggest themselves
may be of aid in the prophylaxis and possibly in the treatment of the more insidious
and progressive pulmonary changes that may follow this disease.</p>

<p class='c013'>A large part of the text is devoted to a description of the gross and more minute
pathology of the respiratory tract associated with influenza and its complications, both in
the acute and in the subacute or chronic stages. Incidental lesions of less importance in
other portions of the body that have occurred in these cases are presented briefly, and
emphasis is placed upon a number of special subjects. The order of discussion will be as

<p class='c012'>If the atrium of an infection and its specific etiological agent are undetermined, the
narrator of the pathology of a specific disease is confronted immediately with serious obstacles
in the elaboration of a complete picture. Some writers assume that the respiratory
tract is the portal of entry in influenza (162), though the specific agent is still unknown.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
Whatever the agent, unquestionably it attacks the respiratory tract at a very early stage
in the disease and produces a lesion which becomes responsible for the most serious aspect
of influenza, whether this phase be primary or only a complication.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the lesions which will be considered, therefore, those of the respiratory tract
chiefly will be emphasized. They include the changes in the large air passages, as well as
the pulmonary, alveolar, and interstitial involvement. Unquestionably, a very close association
exists between the lesions of the larger air passages and those of the alveoli, but probably
it is equally true that the former may occur alone; in many instances also they are the
forerunners of the latter lesions. Consequently, it seems logical to begin with an exposition
of the lesions in the trachea and its ramifications, including the bronchioles.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>A. LESIONS OF THE TRACHEA AND BRONCHI</h3>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Gross Picture.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Early in the disease the congestion and the hemorrhages that have been described in
the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx (14 and 94) are also conspicuous features in the
lining of the trachea and bronchi (Fig. <a href='#FIGI'>I</a>). This membrane is swollen, turgid, red, and
covered by a copious, mucous exudate which may be clear, but much more frequently is
blood-stained or opaque and yellowish in color. The blood, variable in amount, may be
fresh and red; and after the mucous exudate on the surface is removed, more intense red
foci stand out on the congested base (47, 90, 157). Frequently, as the bronchi are approached,
the red color of the mucosa becomes more intense and may have a garnet tinge.
Membranes such as are encountered in the more usual necrotizing inflammatory processes,
like diphtheria, have not occurred in the trachea and larger bronchi in this series (108, 128,
157).<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The exudate peels off readily, and as indicated above, leaves a velvety red surface,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>dotted here and there with darker or more intensely red foci. Small ulcerations of the mucosa
occur, but are inconspicuous (82, 156). As the finer ramifications of the bronchi are
approached, the accumulation of the exudate in their lumina becomes more and more marked,
and on cross section of the lung, they often stand out conspicuously on account of their
increased size and projecting, seromucous, blood-stained content (101, 149, 162).</p>

<p class='c013'>It is remarkable how long this picture in the trachea and bronchi may persist without
showing any marked variation. It is encountered, not only in the most acute and fulminating
types of the disease (that have been examined), but a similar picture may be present
in cases which end fatally only after a period of weeks of severe illness. In the latter
cases, however, the exudate, particularly in the bronchioles, assumes a more purulent character
and after this accumulation is wiped away from the surface of the tube, the intensity
of the dark red color of its lining membrane presents an even more striking contrast on account
of the opaque, yellowish-green exudate in the lumen. At this stage, too, the bronchioles
are more distended with pus, which oozes from each one when the lung is sectioned
(1, 108, 110). In the cases still more chronic, the terminal bronchioles may be sharply
outlined with a thick grey wall which surrounds the dilated opening from which the accumulated
yellowish exudate oozes as soon as the pressure is relieved (Figs. <a href='#FIGXXXIX'>XXXIX</a> and
<a href='#FIGXL'>XL</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Histological Picture.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The changes are less marked, perhaps, in the trachea than in its finer ramifications.
The mucosa is constantly more or less destroyed and large areas, usually focal, are entirely
devoid of their epithelial covering. This is replaced by a sparse exudate, composed largely
of red blood cells, mucus, a small amount of fibrin, and nuclear fragments (Fig. <a href='#FIGII'>II</a>). It
may dip into the submucosa for a short distance, but usually these indentures are associated
with the ducts of the mucous glands into which the inflammatory reaction extends. A more
striking feature than the exudate, however, is the edema and the congestion of the submucosa.
The loose areolar tissue of the submucosa is spread widely apart, and throughout it
distended blood vessels are very conspicuous. Occasionally such a vessel is broken and
actual hemorrhage appears in the submucosa. Occasionally, too, the inflammation extends
down the duct to the mucous gland itself, and here, also, aplastic inflammatory reaction is
evident, inasmuch as the acini now stain intensely red with the cells undifferentiated from
each other and specked here and there by broken remains of the dead nuclei (Fig. <a href='#FIGIII'>III</a>).
After the disease has continued for a short period, even at the end of five or six days,
some regeneration of the epithelial lining may be seen (3) (Fig. <a href='#FIGIV'>IV</a>). But despite this, the
acute picture persists, and there goes on, side by side, an attempted repair characterized by
epithelial regeneration and the same evidence of acute change. Since the lesion is essentially
a superficial one, scars or contractures of any extent are not encountered in the trachea,
even in examples of the disease that have ended fatally only after many weeks.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>There is considerable evidence to support the view that the disease spreads from
bronchus to bronchus, and in keeping with this view, various stages in the inflammatory
processes are more readily determined in these smaller structures than in the trachea.
Furthermore, it must be emphasized that even the mildest and the most extreme of these
stages are not infrequently encountered in the same lung. The earliest lesion is manifested
by an increased homogeneity of the protoplasm of the epithelial lining of the bronchus.
The cell protoplasm loses its normal granulation and the nucleus, somewhat darker
than usual, becomes conspicuous on a red base (Fig. <a href='#FIGV'>V</a>). In the lumen of such a tube a serous
exudate, perhaps mixed with mucus, is encountered, and there is some spreading apart
of the surrounding muscular tissue with engorgement of the vessels. This picture merges
gradually into one where the epithelium appears as a homogeneous, red-staining ribbon,
devoid of nuclei, often exfoliated, in part at least, from the underlying submucosa (92).
The change is traceable through the larger bronchi, even to the ducti alveolares, and not
infrequently, bacteria, either as a diffuse, minute dotting or in the form of circumscribed,
colony-like formations, are spread through the red, ribbon-like strand (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVI'>XVI</a>). With
the exfoliation of the epithelial lining, the submucous vessels become more and more conspicuous
and may bulge into the lumen of the tube (Fig. <a href='#FIGVI'>VI</a>). That they actually weep
into the lumen is proved by the presence of red blood cells in the exudate, now rich in mucus,
broken-down nuclei, and desquamated cells. The necrotizing process may not extend
deeper than the epithelial lining as is the status described above (140, 162), but it also
frequently involves the underlying submucous and muscular layers, so that these lose their
identity and stand out as homogeneous masses, in which fragmented nuclei and bacterial
accumulations are prominent. Such deeper necrotizing areas may be focal (Fig. <a href='#FIGVII'>VII</a>), or
may involve the entire circumference of the tube (Fig. <a href='#FIGVIII'>VIII</a>). Occasionally, the epithelium,
now dead and staining homogeneously, is lifted from the underlying submucosa in the form
of a blister (66), and has very much the same appearance as the well known, early reaction
which follows the application of croton oil to the rabbit’s ear. Where this occurs, the submucosa
is less involved, as though the necrotizing agent had not penetrated to the same
depth and the serous reaction beneath were actually a beneficent exudate. These blisters
are in contrast with the deeper areas where the fibrinous mass, mixed with the dead tissue,
forms an intensely staining ring or band, which extends through the bronchiolar wall even
to the surrounding alveoli.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the early stage of this process one of the most outstanding features is the absence
of polynuclear leucocytes in the reactionary process, but gradually as the dead tissue
sloughs away, these cells wander into the exudate and form a purulent ring, more intense
in the lumen, but extending for a variable distance through the still viable wall of the structure
(47) (Fig. <a href='#FIGIX'>IX</a>). Later mononuclear cells accumulate in this wall and occur either as a
diffuse mottling or as circumscribed foci in the muscle and submucous layer of the bronchiole,
just as they do in the trachea. Occasionally, a striking change is found in a small
bronchiole within a portion of the lung which is otherwise uninvolved by an inflammatory
process. Perhaps the alveoli were the seat of a change which has subsided, but, whatever
the history, the purulent mass in the bronchiole and involving its wall, stands out effectively
(Fig. <a href='#FIGX'>X</a>).</p>

<p class='c013'>Sooner or later, with the subsidence of the irritating agent, repair begins in the bronchus
or bronchiole. If its walls have been destroyed and the lesion has extended into the
surrounding alveoli to form an abscess of greater or lesser extent, or if the necrotizing process
has been superficial and confined to the epithelium in large part, the reparative process
is very much the same. Mitotic figures in the fibroblasts and in the endothelial cells
of the capillaries abound in the young granulations (Fig. <a href='#FIGXI'>XI</a>). However, the granulation
tissue does not have an unrestricted path of growth, for if a remnant of epithelium remains,
this is stimulated to grow probably in this disease as in no other. Mitotic figures are common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and the young epithelial cells stretch across the denuded submucosa or granulation
(Fig. <a href='#FIGXLVIII'>XLVIII</a>) and extend downward into the surrounding alveoli, not only as strands, but
also as solid nests of cells (47) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLIX'>XLIX</a>). The bronchioles, therefore, show changes dependent
upon the extent of the damage suffered by their walls. The vast majority, in all
probability, will be restored; but if the wall has actually been necrotized, the bronchioles
may be converted into small, saccular, bronchiectatic cavities (48, 110, 162) (Figs. <a href='#FIGXII'>XII</a> and
<a href='#FIGL'>L</a>), or obliterating bronchiolitis may result from the organization of the exudate within their
lumina (82) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXI'>XI</a>). The importance of the epithelial proliferation cannot be ignored;
in many cases, it invades the surrounding lung tissue and a typical, histological picture
results—an infiltrating, malignant, epithelial neoplasm (Figs. <a href='#FIGXLVIII'>XLVIII</a> and <a href='#FIGXLIX'>XLIX</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Summary.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The lesions of the trachea and of the larger bronchi, even though they persist in their
acute form for a period of weeks, are superficial and do not lead to extensive or deep scarring.
In contrast to the larger respiratory passages, that portion of the bronchial tree which
is not supported by cartilaginous rings becomes more and more intensely involved, not only
on its surface, but in its deeper structures, and the changes in the bronchioles and the neighboring
air sacs are among the more characteristic anatomical manifestations in this disease.
Therefore, while it will be unnecessary to refer again to the larger air passages, further consideration
of the smaller ones, which are constantly associated with the lesions of the pulmonary
parenchyma, will be included in the subsequent discussion of the pulmonic involvement.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>B. LESIONS OF THE LUNG</h3>

<p class='c020'>In the prosecution of the scientific study of any disease, the great temptation is to
differentiate its various manifestations with the intention of elaborating a classification.
While there may be more or less distinct types of pulmonary involvement in influenza, so
many intermediary forms appear in an extensive series of cases, that any classification must
necessarily be arbitrary. Here, such an attempt at classification is beset with unusual
difficulty, because, in the vast majority of cases which come to anatomical observation, the
disease is fulminating. The lesions are more uniform in character than in an experimental
study where the material is arranged so as to include intermediary and chronic stages, which
in man are only encountered when accident causes death. These gaps in the study cannot
be supplemented with experimental observations, because attempts to reproduce this disease
have failed, even in human subjects. From the literature it appears also that variations
in the extent, and perhaps in the maturation, of the anatomical involvement may be
represented in different proportions for different localities (1, 2, 17, 55, 92, 162). Therefore,
no sharp differentiation may be drawn between the more or less definite stages which
are seen at the post-mortem table; still, for convenience of description, certain of the lesions
which occur more frequently and are more widely differentiated may be considered separately.</p>

<p class='c013'>The disease, as has been indicated, may be confined to the bronchial tree. In these
circumstances, it is almost necessary to suppose that the larger bronchi alone are involved.
When the delicate bronchioles are affected, there is always a more or less extensive involvement
of the pulmonary parenchyma (124), for the bronchioles have a more direct communication
with the alveoli, and their walls present a less formidable barrier to the extension of
the inflammation to the surrounding air sacs.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Clinically, there is reason to believe that the disease may begin with a period of general
malaise, during which the respiratory symptoms may be more or less severe. In the
fulminating cases, the malaise may be associated from the beginning, not only with a tracheobronchitis,
but also with pulmonary involvement. In less severe types the malaise
may be accompanied only by tracheobronchitis, and may present no symptoms referable
to the pulmonary parenchyma; there may follow or not, a definite period of clinical
improvement, after which pneumonic involvement becomes evident. However, even where
a fulminating type of the disease is not associated with clinical evidence of pulmonary involvement,
the post-mortem examination may show extensive change in the lung parenchyma
(110).</p>

<p class='c013'>Whether this grouping of the disease is correct or is based upon a fallacious deduction
from more or less satisfactory clinical histories, is open to question; and a decision may be
reached from comparison of the opinions based upon carefully observed cases treated in
different institutions. From the report of the epidemic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital
(Bloomfield and Harrop (14)), where two hundred sixty-eight cases were studied in which
the complication of pneumonia was uncommon as compared with cases in other hospitals—the
New Haven Hospital, for instance—and where the percentage of the deaths was low, the
conclusion was reached that the disease is primarily a general one and that the pulmonary
involvement is secondary, just as in an exanthem, like measles. By way of comparison, at
the New Haven Hospital, where more than eleven hundred patients with influenza were
observed, the type of disease described by Bloomfield and Harrop was relatively rare. Of
course, there were cases of that type where general malaise, with or without respiratory
symptoms, was followed by a period—usually of from two to three days—of definite improvement
in the symptoms; and later extensive and serious pulmonary complications ensued.
However, in another group, largely composed of individuals who entered the hospital
seriously ill, the histories indicate an acute onset resembling that of lobar pneumonia and
with early manifestations of pulmonary involvement (2, 17, 52, 145). This discrepancy,
probably, may be explained in part by variations in the sensitivity to minor indisposition
on the part of the different individuals.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preceding review should aid in the correlation of the clinical types of the disease
with the respiratory lesions. All pulmonary lesions, from the least to the most localized,
may be explained either by a subsidence of a less acute initial and diffuse involvement of the
parenchyma, or by a less rapid and progressive spread of the necrotizing and inflammatory
process from the upper respiratory tract through the bronchioles to the alveoli. This conception
does not take into account the significance of the period of malaise, interpreted by
the clinician as the period of invasion, but attempts to correlate the respiratory symptoms
with the pulmonary lesions and their etiology.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our own experience, like that of other observers (26, 104, 162), is that all fatal cases of
this disease show pulmonary involvement in the form of pneumonia. The lesion varies
greatly in intensity and in the amount of pulmonary tissue affected. In the descriptions
which follow, the more diffuse and intense processes will be discussed first, and later those
in which the inflammation localized and terminated in pseudolobar, lobar, lobular, or peribronchial
pneumonia.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>(1) ACUTE DIFFUSE FULMINATING TYPE OF PNEUMONIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The majority of influenzal deaths have been examples of this acute type. Out of
ninety-five cases, the total number studied, forty-four belong to this group in which the
average duration of illness was nine days. They form the basis of the description which
follows.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Gross Picture.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>A striking feature of the external examination of the body is the intense rigor which
involves all the muscles and is broken only with difficulty (78). This is associated with a
rapid settling of the unclotted blood in the dependent parts which gives them an intense
blue or bluish-purple color. The erythema of the skin which has been described clinically
is not recognizable at the post-mortem table. There is, however, cyanosis of the face which
reaches an intensity explained by the fact that this disease so often affects healthy, well
nourished, muscular individuals. In a few instances the cyanosis is more extensive and
gives a plum color to the entire body. All the mucous membranes share in the intense
congestion and discoloration of the face. Slight jaundice is common, but marked variations
in intensity occur. The external nares and the lips are almost invariably covered with
blood-stained crusts. Even in the decubitus position, a thin, sanguinous fluid tends to
escape in large quantities from the nose and mouth. The large veins of the neck are usually
prominent, and the chest voluminous.</p>

<p class='c013'>Distinct splanchnic engorgement is evident as soon as the peritoneal cavity is opened.
The liver extends below the costal margin and is dark in color, but otherwise the abdominal
cavity presents nothing characteristic of the disease. The diaphragm does not extend as
high as usual, and the pleural cavity almost invariably contains an excess of fluid. Usually
the quantity is small, but, on the other hand, it may be considerable, and in twenty-one of
the forty-four cases the fluid exceeded one hundred cubic centimeters. The turgidity of the
mediastinal tissues varies somewhat in degree (27). Generally the pericardial sac is smooth
and glistening on both visceral and parietal surfaces; the pericardial fluid is not materially
changed. Frequently (seventy per cent) there is dilatation of the right side of the heart
(138, 141, 157), but aside from an occasional small endocardial or subepicardial hemorrhage
(90, 108, 156), there are no lesions of consequence in the heart attributable to this disease<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The lungs are extremely voluminous (12, 17) due in part to an accumulation of liquid
within them. This finds its way into the trachea and completely fills the latter structure
with blood-stained, syrupy fluid, with purulent material, or with a mixture of these
(2, 90, 107, 157, 162). At first the pleural surface is smooth and often quite even, but on
closer inspection, a minute granulation is suggested. In many cases even close examination
does not allow the conclusion that an exudation of anything but serum has occurred through
this membrane, except in localized foci. These foci more frequently involve the interlobar
pleura and that of the lower lobes (112, 143). The volume of the lungs, often great enough
to obliterate the pericardial area, is one of the two most characteristic features of the external
examination. The other feature is their color. Small, bright red hemorrhages may
occur anywhere. The larger patches are the most striking. Violet, purple, or dark brown
areas, irregular in shape and distribution, are more frequently found on that portion of the
pleura over the lower two-thirds of the lung. Between the deeply colored zones, there are
pale pink areas which involve the lowermost edge to the least degree, the anterior margin
somewhat more, and the apex of the lung most of all. The darker portions just referred
to may project above the surface and may be circumscribed, resembling huge, fresh hemorrhagic
infarcts (41, 108). The alveolar walls are not seen through the pleural surfaces in
these darker zones. The pale pink areas, usually at the level of the more intensely colored
zones, may be elevated and the dilated air sacs are distinctly made out through the pleura
(Fig. <a href='#FIGXIII'>XIII</a>). At the hilum, the lymph glands are large and soft. When cut, fluid escapes
and is often blood-stained. The cross section may present a distinct, diffuse, hemorrhagic
appearance (162). At the hilus, too, the lymphatics, distended here and there over the
surface of the pleura, are most affected. The congested bronchial mucous membrane
and the exudate in these structures has been described.</p>

<p class='c013'>After removal, the lung retains its shape, but is more flaccid than the consolidated lung
of lobar pneumonia. It cuts with very little resistance and immediately a large amount
of a syrupy, pink fluid escapes and obscures the entire area. With the fluid scraped away,
the variations in the consistency of the lung become visible. The pale areas around the
borders and chiefly at the apex in which the air sacs are discernible with the naked eye, sink
slightly below the remainder of the surface, and the pleural edge inverts. The individual
lobules of the lung in these areas are more conspicuous than normal, because the interstitial
tissue bearing the lymphatics and vessels, as well as that around the bronchi and larger
blood vessels, does not lose its edematous appearance as quickly as the alveoli (40, 92, 110,
164), and, consequently, these grey lines and points stand up somewhat more prominently.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
In contrast with the paler areas which are prone to slight collapse, the remainder of the cross
section retains its more smooth and even surface. The alveolar walls are not distinctly
made out, but the terminal bronchioles often make themselves evident by the nature of the
material which is within and by their distinct dilatation (1, 67, 110, 149, 162). The more
firm areas stand out, too, on account of their difference in color. The scheme is not unlike
that seen on the pleural surface, and while dark, almost black, infarct-like areas occur on
the cut surface, the solid areas are more likely to be translucent, dull, light red, brown or
even grey. They have a surface similar to a very fresh, tuberculous, gelatinous pneumonia,
but the color differs from the cloudy grey of the latter on account of the admixture of blood
in the exudate and the great congestion of the vessels (Fig. <a href='#FIGXIV'>XIV</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Summary.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The well developed post-mortem muscular rigidity, the lividity of the dependent parts,
of the face with its mucous membranes, and often of the trunk, the jaundice variable in
extent, the crusts of blood on the nares and mouth, and the splanchnic dilatation are features
which prepare for the gross picture presented by the thoracic organs. The increased
moisture within the pleural cavities associated with the even, translucent pleural surface,
whose dilated lymphatics become more and more prominent towards the hilum, the large
succulent lymph glands, and the exudate in the bronchial tree, are all striking, but more
characteristic of the gross picture, is the great increase in volume of the lung itself, mottled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>with brilliant colors. The lung, too, is very wet and on section, after the syrupy, blood-stained
fluid escapes from the less definitely consolidated zones, the latter appear, not as the
usual granular, firm areas of hepatization, but have more the consistency of a gel, and also
its translucence. Characteristic of this disease as these changes may be, the specificity of
the fundamental lesion in the respiratory tract, becomes more emphatic after study of its
histology (92, 162).</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Histological Picture.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>No matter what the portion of the lung from which the sections are derived, the fundamental
changes found are the same. The subpleural sheets are spread wide apart, now by
empty spaces, now by coagulated fluid. The process extends from the surface through the
interlobular septa (Fig. <a href='#FIGXX'>XX</a>), and is accentuated where the connective tissue is more
prominent around vessels and bronchi. The nature of the infiltrate in the subpleural
and interstitial tissues becomes more evident in the alveoli, which likewise are filled. The
material varies somewhat in appearance, probably dependent upon its proteid content.
Not infrequently the alveoli contain a homogeneous, pink-staining mass, which resembles
the colloid of the thyroid gland. Again, it may be simply a coarse granular precipitate
(Fig. <a href='#FIGXXIII'>XXIII</a>), and in still other instances, small sticks and strands form the bulk of the
alveolar content (47, 92, 140, 156). This subpleural, interstitial, perivascular, peribronchial,
and alveolar edema, which is a term applicable to this collection of fluid, is very prominent,
and although its intensity varies in different portions of the lung; and although it may
be replaced in some areas by other types of exudate, unquestionably, this is the dominating
expression of the inflammatory process in the early stage of the disease.</p>

<p class='c013'>As might be expected from the gross appearance, the alveoli vary in size. At times
slightly collapsed and at other times overdistended, their lumina are still the seat of the
inflammatory exudate, although the mechanical change may allow of some variation in the
appearance of their walls. As a rule, however, the alveolar wall is prominent and owes its
conspicuousness to the tortuous, engorged vessels within. These vessels contain red blood
cells almost exclusively, and on account of the partial, occasionally complete, loss of the
lining epithelium, the alveolar wall appears as a huge, dilated arteriole (101) separating the
lakes of coagulated material in the spaces (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXIII'>XXIII</a>). There are areas, as indicated
above, where the alveolar content may be more definitely arranged in the form of beaded
or homogeneous strands of different caliber; the smallest resemble delicate threads. They
tend to converge toward the alveolar wall like wheat in a sheaf, and often pass through
this wall by way of the so-called pores of Cohn; as soon as the body of the neighboring alveolus
is reached, they again present a fan-like expansion into innumerable, fine strands (Fig.
<a href='#FIGXXII'>XXII</a>). Where the exudate is more fibrinous, the alveolar wall is less likely to be distended,
its vessels are not so prominent, and their content of red blood cells is definitely decreased.
Still this is not the most extreme type of alveolar exudate met with at this stage. Perhaps,
the most striking, although not the most frequent, exudate has a superficial resemblance to
a huge, red blood clot, and it may be difficult to make out the alveolar walls separating the
masses of well preserved red blood cells that fill the alveolar spaces. These areas are indistinguishable
from infarcts and may be associated with thrombotic arteritis in near-by pulmonary
vessels (47) (Figs. <a href='#FIGXXIV'>XXIV</a> and <a href='#FIGXXV'>XXV</a>). Among the red blood cells an occasional
strand of fibrin, a desquamated alveolar epithelial cell, and rarely a polymorphonuclear
leucocyte may be encountered. The alveolar wall itself varies in the definition of its outline.
When its vessels are greatly distended, when its alveolar epithelium is gone, and
when its content consists largely of red blood cells, it is difficult to distinguish from the
exudate which it encloses. However, when it is more compressed or when its epithelial
lining cells are still more or less intact, it may be seen as a blue-staining strand under the
low power of the microscope, for the well preserved nuclei lend it prominence.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>There are, of course, variations in the extent of the serum, the fibrin, and the hemorrhage
in the exudate of the alveoli, and while these different types may occur as pure forms,
often they are associated. In still other areas and varying in prominence, one finds as
characteristic an exudate, not only of serum, strands of fibrin, and red blood cells, but also
a diffuse dotting of the exudate with bacteria, singly, in pairs, clumps, and chains (92, 164)
(Fig. <a href='#FIGXXI'>XXI</a>). This type of reaction is uncommon in pulmonary disease. It resembles
more closely a streptococcus cellulitis such as is encountered frequently in the subcutaneous
tissues, for example, a woody phlegmon, or a sero-hemorrhagic exudate like the avirile
response to a rapidly fatal hemolytic streptococcus serositis. A similar reaction has been
reproduced experimentally in animals which have been rendered aplastic with benzol previous
to pulmonary insufflation, and it is conceivable that the lack of polymorphonuclear
response in the inflammatory exudate may be associated with some such general destruction
or temporary suspension of leucocytic formation (160).</p>

<p class='c013'>A more striking picture, however, even than this aplastic alveolar exudate appears in
the terminal bronchioles. In many instances, these are conspicuous on account of their
size, for they are dilated to form prominent, often irregular, sacs (Fig. <a href='#FIGXV'>XV</a>). The distention
of these terminal bronchioles may be so great that the surrounding alveoli are compressed.
What makes them even more conspicuous is their lining, once epithelium, but now a
swollen, thick, homogeneously staining material, with complete loss of architecture; the
material forms (with hematoxylin and eosin) a red band limiting the lung tissue and sharply
demarcating it from the exudate within the bronchioles (48, 92). However, this ribbon of
red, often thickened by fibrin deposition, is not always pure, for bacteria thrive in the dead
tissue. They occur singly, paired, in chains, and also as circumscribed, dense masses which
in size and position, simulate nuclei (162) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVI'>XVI</a>). This same hyalinization of the
epithelium, it will be recalled, occurs in the larger bronchi (Fig. <a href='#FIGV'>V</a>), and there, too, bacteria
frequently develop in the dead tissue (Fig. <a href='#FIGVIII'>VIII</a>). In the smallest bronchiolar ramifications,
acute epithelial necrosis is not infrequently encountered, even when the surrounding lung
tissue is relatively normal (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVI'>XVI</a>). That the process does not stop with the epithelium,
but, as in the larger bronchi, may extend through the entire structure of the bronchioles, is
manifest. Even the alveolar walls may be involved and frequently homogeneous pink or
red bands, now the phantom of the former viable lung tissue, mark the presence of the old
wall of the alveolus (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVII'>XVII</a>). Occasionally, some architecture remains in this pink
ribbon and then the involvement seems to be primarily in the vessels of the wall. Not all
the vessels are involved, and next to a hyaline thrombus in one, there may be fresh blood,
usually red blood, in its neighbor. The alveolar epithelium is usually denuded and thus
accentuates the intensity of the change.</p>

<p class='c013'>The acute death which involves the tracheal, bronchial, and bronchiolar epithelium and
which may extend beyond the epithelium into the walls of these structures and kill en masse
the walls of the alveoli, is a lesion which does not occur in other types of acute pulmonary
infection. However, in influenza, as after exposure to pulmonary irritating gases, it is the
lesion of characterization (158,159). The effects of this change, of course, where it involves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the alveolar wall, will vary with the extent of the process; but given an absolutely necrotic
wall, as yet unstrengthened by inflammatory reaction, an expected result would be its rupture
with respiratory movement. The point of rupture is important, but where so many
alveoli are involved, disturbance of continuity will occur, occasionally in such position that
the result will be the escape of air into the interstitial tissues.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> There is ample evidence
that this happens. Indeed, among the clinical manifestations of the disease, interstitial
emphysema of the lung spreading through the fascial planes to the subcutaneous tissues of
neck and thorax is well known; the phenomenon is more frequent and extensive in influenza
than in any other disease (8, 17, 52, 143).</p>

<p class='c013'>Interstitial emphysema is very striking at the post-mortem table. The escaped air
appears as beads along the interlobular septa, but on account of their size they are always
most conspicuous between the lobes and along the vessels toward the hilum (162) (Fig.
<a href='#FIGXVIII'>XVIII</a>). Histologically, a small bubble of escaped air confined to the interlobular septum
compresses the surrounding tissue with almost complete atelectasis of many neighboring
alveoli (Fig. <a href='#FIGXIX'>XIX</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Summary.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The diffuse involvement of all the lung tissue, chiefly with a serous exudate in the
subpleural, interstitial, perivascular, and peribronchial tissues, as well as in the alveoli,
is associated with other elements which occur in aplastic reactions; red blood cells, fibrin,
and bacteria. Added to the aplastic exudate is an acute necrosis of bronchial and alveolar
epithelium involving at times the walls of these structures; consequently, the histology of
this disease is almost as specific as that of any biological reaction.</p>

<p class='c020'>In the preceding description, the gross and microscopic anatomical changes in the lung
have been discussed minutely. The picture presented persists, even though it becomes less
intense, and forms a background upon which later variations may be superimposed. There
is no justification for the opinion that the changes described are necessarily the most acute,
but it is presumably correct to suppose that an aplastic, inflammatory reaction will terminate
fatally more quickly than a cellular reaction (160), and upon this basis the sequential
description in this narrative is arranged.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the group of fatal cases of influenza, now to be discussed, the lesions of the pulmonary
parenchyma are characterized by more definite lung consolidation. Thirty-nine examples

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The fluid of the pleural cavities varies volumetrically as described in the preceding
section. It is, however, usually not a clear fluid, but varies from a slightly turbid, blood-stained
material to a typical purulent exudate. The cloudiness may be associated with
minute flecks of suspended material, but in no instance has this fluid been of the thick inspissated
type which formerly would have been designated as empyema.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> (This is mentioned
with the knowledge that the term empyema is being applied now to less viscid,
purulent, pleural exudates). The turgidity of the mediastinal tissue also persists, but it is
very rare indeed to find anything more than a small amount of clear fluid in the pericardial
sac. Only once was there a typical, fibrinous pericarditis with effusion, and this occurred
where a most extensive pleural exudate was also present.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Where such complications have
been described in serous membranes, the bronchial lymph glands, particularly at the hilum
of the lung, are more involved and show, not only an increase in size and a red color on cross
section, but frequently also focal areas of necrosis at the periphery, which appear as yellow
patches and subsequently undergo suppurative disintegration (2, 47).</p>

<p class='c013'>The lung remains increased in volume and its surface is mottled with vivid colors.
Often these are an indication of deeper parenchymatous change. The pale pink zones,
through the pleural surface of which distended alveoli are discernible, are still prominent
in the upper lobe, around the margins, and on the anterior surface of the lung. The darker
purple, slightly elevated, often circumscribed, infarct-like areas (25, 34, 108) may occur
anywhere, but are more frequent in the lower lobes. Small, maroon, slightly depressed
areas of atelectasis may also involve the borders of the lung, usually the posterior borders;
or they may occur between larger and more elevated areas on either lobe. Besides the purple,
firm, projecting foci, paler pink or grey nodules of similar consistence may be present
and show no structure when viewed through the pleura. The distribution of the different
types of change is variable, and, aside from the fact that they involve the middle and lower
lobes more frequently than the upper, no general statement is possible. In a few instances,
one lobe, almost always the lower, may be more voluminous than the others, and although
its pleura often suggests lobular involvement, the masses tend to be confluent and suggest
a pseudolobar change. Sometimes, though rarely, this approaches a true lobar type of
consolidation. (Compare Figs. <a href='#FIGXIII'>XIII</a> and <a href='#FIGXXVII'>XXVII</a>.) Occasionally, the changes in the lung,
except its increase in size, are obscured by pleural exudate which may form a thick, buttery,
rather sticky mass on the surface (12, 19, 157) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXVII'>XXXVII</a>). Such pleural exudates
are rare, and likewise it is uncommon to find so little pleural granulation as in the previous
group. The roughening, as a rule, is not uniform, but is more prominent over the lower
lobes and in the interlobar spaces than elsewhere. It may occur when there is no definite
increase in the fluid content of the pleural sac.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lung, now sectioned, presents a surface in accord with the changes suggested from
the description of its external appearance. As compared with the first stage the amount of
syrupy, blood-stained exudate may be definitely decreased, especially in the upper lobe or
in those portions of the lung where the solidification is less marked. Its character, too, may
be more cloudy, and more ropy, or viscid; it bathes the surface and is scraped off in abundance
with the blade of a knife from the underlying consolidated foci (108, 156). The bronchi
and bronchioles, however, may be prominent, irrespective of the change in the parenchyma
itself. From their lumina, thick, yellow pus wells forth and their mucous membrane
is intensely congested. Where such involvement occurs in unconsolidated portions of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>lung, the bronchioles are even more striking than in the hepatized areas in which the more
widespread changes obscure the process. The dilatation of the bronchioles, especially in
their smaller ramifications, is still conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c013'>The consolidated areas vary greatly in size and number;<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> often they are small and involve
only single lobules, which now stand out as granular, generally elevated patches on
the surrounding congested plane. Their color, as on the pleura, varies. They may be
dark, almost hemorrhagic, fading through the reds, pinks, and greys. They may be firm,
or, at the other extreme, honeycombed by small, often narrow, cavities, from which a
material similar to that described on the surface wells forth. The latter change is more
frequent if the consolidated area is large. It has occurred most often in the pseudolobar
and in the lobar types of the process. The pseudolobar change is differentiated, not only
by the confluence of more or less definite lobular patches and by its involvement of portions
of contiguous lobes rather than a single lobe, but also by variations in the color and consistence
of the different lobular foci. This is in contrast with lobar involvement where the
entire lobe is affected by a uniform process usually at the same stage of development. Although
the consistence may vary in different portions, usually the same color is present
throughout. (Compare Figs. <a href='#FIGXIV'>XIV</a> and <a href='#FIGXXVIII'>XXVIII</a>.) In one instance where a solid, yellow
lobe was found, its center contained an irregular, fresh blood clot (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVIII'>XVIII</a>), which would
be sufficient to differentiate this type of consolidation from that of respiratory disease in
which the initial lesion is less destructive. Sometimes the softening in a hepatized lobule
or group of lobules is much more evident, and the zone becomes divided by irregular channels
filled with viscid, grey or brown material (108, 149, 162). When such a condition lies
just beneath the pleural surface, it may be distinctly seen from without (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXIII'>XXXIII</a>).
The pleura bulges, the normal topography of the local zone is lost, and it appears as a dull,
somewhat projecting, circumscribed patch, two or three or more centimeters in diameter,
the surface of which has a more or less characteristic brown or brownish black opacity. As
soon as this is sectioned there pours from the cavity the liquefied exudate in which the destroyed
pulmonary parenchyma is mixed (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXIV'>XXXIV</a>). Occasionally, strands of tissue
still traverse the cavity, but, as a rule, it empties itself completely, and leaves a brownish
black wall. The delicate, sweet but persistent and penetrating odor is not so marked as
with typical gangrene.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Histological Picture.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Sections from the least involved areas of the lung show a subsidence of the alveolar
exudate and the walls are no longer intensely engorged. Perhaps the most prominent feature
within the alveoli is the desquamated cells, presumably alveolar cells with broken or
pyknotic nuclei. Despite the fact that so many cells of this type occupy the lumen of the
alveolus, its wall has a prominent lining of cubical epithelium. Often mitotic figures abound
in this new alveolar epithelial lining (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLVII'>XLVII</a>), an evidence of rapid regeneration in that
portion of the lung where the initial irritative process has subsided and where the destruction
has not been as deep as elsewhere (79). This picture may be taken as positive evidence
of an initial, diffuse, and general pulmonary involvement, which, with the subsidence of the
primary reaction, is followed by localization resulting in the different types of consolidation
now encountered.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>However, in such areas of slight change, the bronchi and bronchioles may be distended
and filled with polymorphonuclear leucocytes, exfoliated epithelium, and bacteria (Fig. <a href='#FIGX'>X</a>).
It is, of course, possible that infection of the parenchyma may recur from these sources.
Here the extent of involvement of the bronchiolar wall is variable and analogous to those
described previously. Occasionally, too, where the alveolar change has subsided, the interstitial
tissue, particularly that which divides groups of neighboring lobules, may retain
its increased size with fibrous tissue framework spread apart by exudate and punctuated
with an occasional circumscribed purulent mass (92, 95, 110, 156) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXVI'>XXXVI</a>). Such
a miliary abscess within the lymphatics of the interstitial tissue may compress the neighboring
air sacs, themselves entirely free of inflammatory involvement. That these strands of interstitial
tissue, the conduits for the lymphatics, are important barriers against the spread
of an inflammatory process from lobule to lobule by direct extension, is evidenced by the
extreme variation in the amount and type of involvement in neighboring lobules (Fig.
<a href='#FIGXXX'>XXX</a>). This variation is repeatedly encountered and the band of interstitial tissue, often
prominent on account of its edema, separates these lobules the more clearly. In all probability,
the sharp demarcation of the lobular consolidation as described in the gross picture
depends upon the change in the interstitial tissue which tends to localize the infection
(93). This fact suggests that the process within the pulmonary parenchyma spreads along
the bronchial tree rather than from lobule to lobule.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sections from those areas of the lung where the involvement is more marked may show
a histological picture not unlike that described for the aplastic stage, but, in addition, there
are groups of lobules where the exudate is typically purulent and pus cells not only form
the greater part of the exudate in the lumen, but are prominent in the distended vessels of
the alveolar wall (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXIX'>XXIX</a>). Often these leucocytes are multilobed and frequently
their protoplasm is granulated with phagocytized bacteria. The bacteria are also encountered
free in the alveolus along with other elements; namely, red blood cells, strands of
fibrin, or precipitated albumin (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXI'>XXI</a>). The bacteria, however, are not particularly
conspicuous, for generally they are either single, in pairs, or in chains; and it is only when
they become clumped to form large masses, often larger than any normal tissue cell, that
they attract attention. When this appearance is encountered, the alveolar wall is no
longer distinct and well preserved. Although the wall may still be made out, it often stains
rather homogeneously and much of the finer architecture is lost in the thrombo-necrotizing
process that has been instituted (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVII'>XVII</a>).</p>

<p class='c013'>From this intermediary stage the picture of actual abscess with mortification of bronchiolar
and alveolar tissue, as well as of the exudate itself, is readily approached (25, 48,
110, 140) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXI'>XXXI</a>). In the necrotic mass that forms the center of such a focus, the
most prominent feature is the bacteria. With hematoxylin they stain intensely as black,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>irregular masses, and their prominence is accentuated by the homogeneous staining qualities
(with eosin) of the dead tissue, whether lung or exudate (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXII'>XXXII</a>). These abscesses
may have central cavities which represent a discharge of their contents and may indicate
the position of a bronchiole (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXI'>XXXI</a>). The necrosis of the alveolar walls, focal in its
distribution as previously described, suggests itself as a forerunner of the more extensive
necrosis encountered at this stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most extreme form of mortification is seen in the wall of a gangrenous cavity, and
several layers can be distinguished there. Beginning with that portion of the lung the least
involved, the lesion may be limited to congestion of the alveolar wall with a serofibrinous
exudate in the lumen, but this stage passes rather rapidly into another where cellular exudate,
chiefly of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, predominates. Moreover, the leucocytes
form not only the bulk of the alveolar content, but also distend the vessels and accumulate
in the interstitial tissue around blood vessels and lymphatics. Passing toward the center
of the gangrenous cavity, the lung rapidly changes in appearance. The blue zone of leucocytic
infiltration makes more conspicuous the inner area of necrosis—where nuclei no
longer stain and the alveolar wall is a homogeneous pink.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gradually this phantom architecture, spotted only here and there with disintegrating
polymorphonuclear leucocytes, ends in a ragged compressed border of a shaggy pink material
which has no identifying qualities (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXV'>XXXV</a>). In the inner zone of pink an occasional
vessel or, at times, a bronchiole more resistant to the process remains; frequently it is
accentuated by the presence of partially destroyed polymorphonuclear leucocytes at its
periphery. Probably these cells invade the necrotic areas along the sheath of the bronchus
or vessel and not across the dead area. The thrombotic process described in the previous
stage (Fig. <a href='#FIGLII'>LII</a>) associated with an acute arteriolitis, may be associated with these gangrenous
areas as well as with infarcts (82), but more likely gangrene is preceded by the acute
diffuse necrosis of the alveolar wall which occurs in the fulminating cases. Furthermore,
this is suggested where a typical grey hepatization is associated with marked thinning,
but not actual disappearance, of the alveolar wall. Before concluding the description of
this stage of the disease, mention should be made of the granular nodules of fibrin superimposed
upon the swollen pleural cells and also of the older pleural exudate, either typically
fibrinopurulent or more homogeneous with broken nuclear fragments (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXVIII'>XXXVIII</a>).</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Summary.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>In this stage of the disease the respiratory change is characterized by a localization of
the inflammatory process with cellular invasion of the exudate. Pneumonia results, varying
in extent from peribronchial to lobar, a pneumonia in which one of the most frequent complications
is necrosis of the lung. Consequently, abscesses, even gangrene, are found.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>(3) ORGANIZATION OF BRONCHIOLAR AND PNEUMONIC PROCESSES.</h3>

<p class='c020'>The processes described for the preceding group which involve not only the alveoli,
but also the bronchi and the bronchioles, were predicted from the extensive hyalinization
of these structures—a characteristic change in the more fulminating and acute phases of
the disease. Likewise, it can be predicted that where death does not terminate the process
such lesions will be followed by organization, which, by converting the exudate into scar,
will produce deformities and offer serious mechanical interference with the ingress and egress
of alveolar air and similar interference with the flow of blood through the pulmonary circulation
(82).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>It is probable that chronic processes, not sufficiently severe to terminate fatally in a
few weeks or months, may occur, but few examples of that kind have been observed. A
total of twelve cases of our series in which organization of the bronchiolar (47), or alveolar
exudate (156) was found, include three of the lobar, three of the pseudolobar, two of the
lobular, and four of the peribronchial types. Such a differentiation, it will be understood,
is purely arbitrary. The majority of the cases show, not only a reparative process, but also
a continuance of the acute change, and, indeed, both gross and microscopic pictures of the
lung may be complicated. It will be impossible to give an inclusive description of these
changes, and therefore a few of the most diverse and characteristic will be presented in the
form of case abstracts.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Autopsy No. 140.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>A white female, aged 19 years, entered the New Haven Hospital after five days of fever, prostration,
and cough. She was moderately cyanotic and dyspnœic, but examination of the lungs was
negative except for a few râles at the right base. She was delivered of a six-months’ fœtus two days
later. On the eleventh day of her illness, definite signs of consolidation had developed in the midback
on both sides and spread gradually to include the left base and all of the right back to the
level of the 4th dorsal spine. The temperature varied irregularly between 100°F. and 105°F. The
pulse followed the temperature, but averaged 102 per minute, while the respirations remained about
40 per minute.</p>

<p class='c022'>The white blood count on admission was 5,800, but rose gradually to 28,320 cells per cubic
millimeter, with 90% of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The patient died on the twenty-second day
of the disease.</p>

<p class='c022'>Post-mortem examination showed little of interest aside from the thorax. The left pleural
cavity contained 75 cubic centimeters of slightly cloudy fluid. The right was almost completely obliterated
by an organizing fibrinopurulent exudate which bound together the visceral and parietal layers.
The left lung was partially collapsed and covered by a thickened pleura, bluish purple in color, which
at the base and in the interlobar area was finely granular. Crepitation was present at the apex, the
anterior surface, and the borders of the lung; elsewhere the consistency was increased. On section
there was a frothy exudate from the apex and extreme base. These were deep red in color, while the
intervening surface of the lung was paler, but broken by many small, white, elevated nodules which
at first glance resembled tubercles (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXIX'>XXXIX</a>). On close examination each of these was seen to
have a small, depressed center from which pus could be expressed, and on dissection this was seen to
be the wall of a bronchiole. The right lung was more voluminous and covered by a thick, grey,
fibrinopurulent exudate except on the upper anterior border where there were a few small areas of
interstitial emphysema. On section the pleural exudate was seen to be sharply demarcated from the
lung parenchyma by a fine red line. The pseudotubercles of the other lung were here even more
marked and from each exuded a yellow pus which partially obscured the pinkish-grey translucence
of the surface (Fig. <a href='#FIGXL'>XL</a>). The lumina of the larger bronchi were distended. The hilic and
bronchial glands were enlarged and grey.</p>

<p class='c022'>Microscopic examination of sections from the lung showed an extensive bronchopneumonia.
The alveoli of an occasional group of lobules were filled with serum or red blood cells, while still
other areas showed foci of necrotizing pneumonia, actual miliary abscesses in which there were
large clumps of bacteria (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLI'>XLI</a>). Throughout the sections, however, the striking change was
an organization of the exudate, which varied from a few fibroblasts to a well defined connective tissue
almost obliterating the normal architecture (Figs. <a href='#FIGXLI'>XLI</a> and <a href='#FIGXLIV'>XLIV</a>). The alveolar walls in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>areas showed edema only, in others they were almost replaced by a thin line of fibrous tissue, and in
still others, by a hyperplasia of the epithelium which almost filled their lumina. The bronchi exhibited
similar changes, their lumina were filled with an exudate of desquamated epithelium and
leucocytes, which in some places was organizing (Fig. <a href='#FIGXI'>XI</a>), and there was a regeneration of epithelium
evidenced by a piling up of the cells and the presence of mitotic figures in them. The interstitial
tissue showed some edema. The tracheal epithelium was intact, but a few leucocytes and lymphocytes
were scattered through the submucosa.</p>

<p class='c022'>Pneumococcus Type II was recovered from the blood, pleural fluid, and lung. B. influenzæ was
also demonstrated in the lung by smears and cultures.</p>

<p class='c020'>In contrast to this example of a very diffuse, organizing pneumonia, associated with a
marked peribronchial organization where the illness lasted for three weeks with hardly a
remission throughout its course, the following example of necrotizing and organizing lobar
pneumonia may be considered.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Autopsy No. 183.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>A white male, aged 46 years, was admitted to the New Haven Hospital on January 9, 1919,
complaining of “pneumonia.” The family history was unimportant. He stated that he was in the
hospital twelve years ago with typhoid fever and again five years ago with acute cholecystitis.</p>

<p class='c022'>His present illness began two weeks previous to admission with chills, fever, anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, and a slightly productive cough. He was prostrated and drowsy, but could not sleep.
On admission his temperature was 101.5°F., the pulse 124, and the respirations 34 per minute. He
was cyanotic and dyspnœic. The right chest showed signs of consolidation, and fluid below the 3rd
interspace. The white blood count was 8,200 cells per cubic millimeter, 89% being polymorphonuclear
leucocytes. The patient died eighteen hours after admission.</p>

<p class='c022'>The autopsy was held four hours after death and the essential findings were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c022'>Twelve hundred cubic centimeters of fibrinopurulent fluid were found in the right pleural cavity
and the visceral and parietal pleura had a thick, yellow coat of fibrin. The right lung was voluminous,
retained its shape on removal, and weighed 1,800 grams. The lower two lobes were consolidated
and the upper lobe was atelectatic. On section the latter was slightly congested, but not consolidated.
The lower two lobes were fairly smooth and grey, mixed with red areas, and exuded thick,
sanguinous pus. They also showed several necrotic areas in the central portion and, in some instances,
cavities 1 centimeter in diameter filled with sanguinous pus had formed. The bronchi contained
the same material, and on its removal a deep red mucosa was exposed. The left lung showed
some fibrous pleurisy over its lateral, posterior, and diaphragmatic surfaces. There was a firm, puckered
scar at the apex. The lung crepitated throughout, and on section was essentially normal except
for moderately intense injection of the bronchi. The hilic nodes were enlarged, soft, succulent,
moderately injected, and pigmented. The trachea was pale, but was covered by a mucopurulent
exudate. The right side of the heart was moderately dilated. The spleen was not enlarged, but was
softened and congested. The liver was pale, slightly decreased in consistency, and congested. The
kidneys and adrenals showed cloudy swelling. The gall-bladder contained several stones, had a
thickened wall, and was bound to the pylorus by firm, fibrous adhesions.</p>

<p class='c022'>Microscopic examination of the lung showed the alveoli filled with an acute inflammatory
exudate in many stages of degeneration and hyalinization (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLII'>XLII</a>). Abscesses were frequent,
but were for the most part small. A similar necrotic mass was contained in the bronchi. There
were, however, features of the microscopic picture that outweighed those already described. The
alveolar and bronchiolar exudates were everywhere being invaded by a young granulation tissue,
rich in fibroblasts and capillaries. Mononuclear cells abounded in the new tissue. Even more
striking than the mesodermal new growth was the epithelial proliferation which could be seen in
many areas. It not only attempted to cover the denuded bronchial surfaces, but stretched over
masses of exudate and granulation in the lumina and extended in tongue-like projections for a considerable
distance into the surrounding lung tissue (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLVIII'>XLVIII</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Cultures of the blood, lung, and pleural fluid showed gram-positive, bile insoluble diplococci
which formed chains, and morphologically and culturally were Streptococcus mucosus capsulatus.</p>

<p class='c020'>These two examples differ widely in the distribution of the pulmonary involvement.
They show the acute inflammatory process persisting and complicating the attempt at
repair, which manifests itself, not only by the formation of granulation tissue, but also by
extensive epithelial proliferation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still a third type of chronic lesion is manifested in Autopsy No. 209, where the necrotizing
and organizing process in the pulmonary parenchyma is associated with typical
saccular bronchiectatic cavities.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Autopsy No. 209.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>A white woman, aged 55 years, was admitted to the New Haven Hospital complaining of weakness
and ill health following pleurisy. For the past seventeen years she had suffered from a gradually
progressing arthritis, which had resulted in marked deformity and disability. Five weeks before
admission she became ill with chills, fever, cough, and pain on both sides of the chest. Thereafter,
her general condition had gradually grown worse.</p>

<p class='c022'>Physical examination showed a markedly emaciated white woman with a high degree of arthritis
deformans. Dullness and fine râles were present at the left apex. The temperature was but slightly
elevated until three days before death, when it rose to 101°F. and slight dullness developed at the
right base with bronchial breathing and fine râles. The white blood count, which on admission had
been 9,200 cells per cubic millimeter, rose to 15,000 per cubic millimeter. She died after a seven-weeks’
illness.</p>

<p class='c022'>At necropsy, with the exception of the joints, little of interest was found outside the thoracic
cavity. On the posterior and diaphragmatic surfaces of both lungs fibrous adhesions were present
binding the visceral to the parietal pleura. The right lung was moderately voluminous and grey in
color over the upper lobe, but had darker red areas over the surface of the lower lobes. Patches of
increased consistency were found in the lower part of the upper lobe, in the middle lobe, and at the
base. On section there was a slight, red, serous exudate. The surface over the more solid areas was
somewhat translucent, grey or light red, and was firm and not friable. The bronchi of the lower
lobes were conspicuous, and at the extreme base so dilated as to give almost a honeycombed appearance.
From them yellow pus exuded. The left lung was less voluminous and showed some increase
in consistency throughout. In the lower lobe this was more uniform, but the upper had a shotty
feeling. On section the upper lobe showed many hard or caseous nodules, with occasional patches
of grey, gelatinous pneumonia. One small cavity was present about 3 centimeters from the apex.
The lower lobe showed no gross evidence of any tuberculous process. Many pseudotubercles projected
from the red surface, but from each pus could be expressed exposing the slightly congested wall of
a bronchiole. At the extreme base two small cavities filled with yellow pus were present (Fig. <a href='#FIGL'>L</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Sections from the left upper lobe showed, microscopically, both a chronic and acute tuberculous
process. Tubercles with a definite wall were present, but there were also large areas of caseation.
The tissue between showed interstitial organization with mononuclear infiltration and occasional
groups of leucocytes. The bronchial epithelium exhibited no marked change, but the bronchi were
filled with pus cells.</p>

<p class='c022'>Sections from the left lower lobe and from the right lung showed both necrotization and organization.
The alveoli contained an exudate, fibrinous, serous, and hemorrhagic, but predominantly
leucocytic. There was slight necrotization of alveolar walls in some areas with infiltration of leucocytes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in them and in the interstitial tissue. Several sections showed a marked degree of interstitial
organization (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLVI'>XLVI</a>). The bronchi were filled with a purulent exudate which sometimes involved
the walls to form a peribronchial abscess. The walls of other bronchi showed great thickening
with infiltration of both mononuclear cells and leucocytes, and many saccular dilatations were
found (Fig. <a href='#FIGXII'>XII</a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>The post-mortem blood culture showed a small, gram-negative, hemoglobinophilic bacillus (B.
influenzæ). Cultures from lungs and bronchi yielded hemolytic streptococci, and Staphylococcus
aureus was also present in the lung.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Summary.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>Of the ninety-five cases included in this report, twelve showed the reparative process in
a more or less marked degree. Furthermore, the twelve showing organization had an illness
averaging twenty-seven days in duration, whereas for the eighty-three cases in which
there was no organization, the period of illness averaged nine days. Thus, it appears that
the early fatal termination of the disease in the latter group is responsible for the absence
of organization.</p>

<p class='c013'>With one exception, when organization was encountered, the disease had run a relatively
acute course without marked remission until death. In this instance, the fatal outcome
was the result of an accident at a time when all the clinical evidence pointed toward
a subsidence of the acute disease. The history of this patient is abstracted below, for it
may throw light upon possible relapse and upon late, chronic, respiratory changes.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Autopsy No. 163.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>A white male, aged 35 years, was admitted to the New Haven Hospital on December 5, 1918,
complaining of “cough, pain in the chest, and headache.” For six days he had had fever, chills, and
severe frontal headache, and for three days pains in the chest. He had also had “coryza” and
epistaxis. The family and past histories were unimportant.</p>

<p class='c022'>The physical examination showed a well developed and well nourished male, who was slightly
jaundiced and markedly prostrated. The conjunctivæ were injected. The heart, abdomen, extremities,
and right lung were negative. In a small area outside the left nipple and extending into
the axilla, tubular breathing and subcrepitant râles were heard, but no definite signs of consolidation
were made out. The physical signs remained the same during the eight-day stay in the hospital.
At entrance his temperature was 102.8°F. In twelve hours it fell to 100°F., then rose to 103°F.,
where it stayed for twenty-four hours, falling by lysis and remaining normal for the three last days.
On his eighth day in the hospital, the patient suddenly collapsed and died within fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c022'>The autopsy was held one hour after death and the essential findings were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c022'>The peritoneal cavity contained 100 cubic centimeters of clear, straw-colored fluid and the viscera,
particularly the liver, were acutely congested. The right side of the heart was greatly dilated; and on
opening the pulmonary artery <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> considerable blood gushed forth under pressure and a huge,
tortuous embolus completely filled the vessel and its branches (Fig. <a href='#FIGLIII'>LIII</a>). The veins of the vesicoprostatic
plexus on the right, and the right internal and external iliac veins contained thrombi,
and it was evidently from this region that the embolus had been set free. The pleura of the lower
third of the left lung over an oval area about 13 × 5 centimeters was bound to the parietal pleura by
pinkish-grey, translucent adhesions which were evidently of comparatively recent origin. Here
the lung was firmly consolidated, but it was apparently normal elsewhere. On section the consolidated
area was silvery grey, with a pink tinge, comparatively dry and smooth. In some areas, especially
about the bronchi, delicate, silvery grey, translucent strands could be seen sweeping out into the
surrounding lung, which contained no air. The remainder of the lung was air-containing. The
trachea showed moderate congestion most marked near the bifurcation. The hilic lymph nodes
were enlarged, soft, congested, and succulent, as well as anthracotic.</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Microscopic examination of the viscera showed acute congestion and some degree of cloudy
swelling in the liver and kidneys. The sections of the lung through the consolidated area showed
the pleura replaced by a thick layer composed of large and small mononuclear cells, some red blood
cells, a rare polymorphonuclear cell, and great numbers of fibroblasts and budding capillaries. Some
of the alveoli contained many red blood cells, a few polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells,
some fibrin, and in many areas fibroblasts were organizing this exudate (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLV'>XLV</a>). Organization
was also present around the bronchi and these contained mucus, pus, and desquamated epithelium.
Frequently strands of fibroblasts were seen sweeping through the bronchiolar exudates, and
in a few instances they had completely filled the lumina.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>II. INFLUENCE OF THE RESPIRATORY COMPLICATION OF INFLUENZA UPON TUBERCULOSIS OF THE LUNG</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Thirteen of the ninety-five cases included in this report occurred at the United States
General Hospital No. 16, one of the large tuberculosis camps. In five instances the patients
had active pulmonary tuberculosis. The remaining eight were members of the detachment
and may be added to the eighty-two from the New Haven Hospital, making a
total of ninety cases in which there was no clinical evidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis
at the onset of the acute respiratory disease. When these ninety cases are analyzed,
it is found that only two of them show definite activation of an old tuberculous focus
(82). One has already been referred to (Autopsy No. 209); the other, presenting a much
more acute exudative and ulcerative tuberculosis, deserves special consideration.</p>

<p class='c023'><i>Autopsy No. 194.</i></p>

<p class='c022'>A white female, aged 27 years, was admitted to the New Haven Hospital on November 8, 1918,
complaining of “cold on the chest, fever, cough, and prostration.”</p>

<p class='c022'>The past and family histories were unimportant. Her illness began one week before admission
with dizziness, headache, vomiting, cough, pains in back and legs, chilly sensations, and fever. She
went to bed the day after. The acute onset became definitely worse and pains developed in her
chest. On admission she was very weak, had a temperature of 101.4°F., a pulse of 120, and respirations
of 40 per minute. The physical examination showed a very well developed and nourished
woman who was cyanotic but not dyspnœic. The pharynx and tonsils were definitely injected.
There were signs of consolidation at the base of the left lung. The pneumonic process gradually
increased in the left, spread to the right, and involved the greater portion of both lungs. Otherwise
the physical signs did not change greatly during her stay of thirteen weeks in the hospital.
Thrombosis of the left femoral vein was diagnosed about two days before her death. The temperature
curve was of interest. During the first two days in the hospital it remained at 104°F. For
two weeks it was septic in character, being 102°F. in the morning and 104°F. in the afternoon. Then
for thirty days it was practically constant at 102°F., only to become septic again, 98.6°F. in the
morning and 103.4°F. in the afternoon, and it remained so until death. The pulse curve ran essentially
parallel to the temperature curve, varying from 100 to 140 per minute. The respirations varied
between 46 and 64 per minute.</p>

<p class='c022'>The sputum showed Type IV pneumococcus. The blood culture was negative.</p>

<p>FIG. XXXIII. GANGRENE OF THE LUNG.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The autopsy was held four hours after death. The body was markedly emaciated. The peritoneal
cavity and its contents appeared normal, though the liver was low. The right pleural cavity
contained 150 c.c. of slightly cloudy, yellow fluid. The left was free from fluid. Both lungs were
bound to the chest wall by silvery grey, translucent adhesions which were broken with slight difficulty.
The right lung was heavy, voluminous, retained its shape on removal, and was consolidated
throughout. Thick, creamy pus exuded from the cut trachea. For the most part, the lung was covered
by a recently organized exudate several millimeters thick in which delicate blood vessels could
sometimes be made out. Beneath the pleura of the lower three-fourths of the lung, were numerous,
irregularly rounded, slightly elevated, opaque, greenish-yellow areas resembling conglomerate tubercles.
These gave the lung a shotty or nodular feeling. In the lowest lobe several of these areas had
fused and softened to form semifluctuant areas several centimeters in diameter. On section the lower
two-thirds of the lung was studded with areas corresponding to those seen on the surface, which in
many instances had broken down and formed irregular cavities filled by thick, green pus (Fig. <a href='#FIGLI'>LI</a>).
Between the green areas delicate strands of new-formed fibrous tissue could be made out in all parts
of the lung. The bronchial mucosa was injected, the walls were irregularly thickened and dilated
and they opened into the ragged cavities noted above. New-formed fibrous tissue was prominent
along the bronchi. One chalky white, old, encapsulated, tuberculous focus was found near the apex
of the left lung.</p>

<p class='c022'>Microscopically, there were two distinct processes found in the sections taken from various
parts of the lung: an early miliary and exudative tuberculosis, and a necrotizing and organizing bronchopneumonia.
Often the two processes were side by side, but sharply demarcated, in the same
section. In others, they might be so intermingled that they could not be differentiated. The
bronchi were filled with pus and often could be seen opening into large abscess cavities. The proliferation
of the bronchial epithelium, as noted elsewhere, also was a striking feature in these sections.
The pleural exudate was undergoing organization.</p>

<p class='c022'>Streptococcus hemolyticus was found in the cultures of the lung, blood, pleural fluid, and
bronchi. In addition, the bronchi and abscess cavities also showed Type IV pneumococcus and
Staphylococcus albus.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'><i>Summary.</i></h3>

<p class='c020'>In this series of ninety-five cases, two examples of activation of an old tuberculous

process was acute and played an important rôle in the fatal outcome.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>III. EXTRARESPIRATORY LESIONS IN INFLUENZA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In all the fatal cases of influenza which came to autopsy, and this has been the experience
of others, the respiratory lesions, as indicated above, occupy the foreground. Indeed,
compared with other types of respiratory disease, the lung involvement is so great that expression
of the disease need not be sought elsewhere to explain the cause of death. However,
there are general systemic changes which, even though quantitatively inconstant,
are sufficiently common and widespread to support the view that the disease is a systemic
one. The lesions of the hematopoietic organs and those of the vascular system are the
most important and will now be taken up.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>A. LESIONS OF THE HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM</h3>

<p class='c020'>There is ample evidence that both the lymphadenoid and myeloid tissues of the body
are affected. The lymph glands at the hilum of the lung naturally are involved with the
extensive pulmonary changes. Also, a similar change may be found in distant nodes,
perhaps associated with drainage from focal lesions or perhaps brought about by general
intoxication.</p>

<p class='c013'>The myeloid involvement is unassociated with focal lesions and finds its early expression
in the equation of the white blood cells of the peripheral blood. The two groups of
changes, those involving the lymphadenoid and those of the myeloid structures, should be
discussed separately.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Lymphadenoid Tissues.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>By far the most extensive lesions are encountered in the lymph glands of the lung and
its hilum, and from here the mediastinal and deep nodes along the trachea are affected to a
greater or lesser extent. The glands are very large and succulent (2, 157, 162, etc.). Very
frequently, indeed, they are hemorrhagic on cross section (34, 108) (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXVII'>XXXVII</a>), and
there exudes a sanguinous fluid, usually thin and syrupy in character. The cut surface
projects slightly, and the edge of the gland everts. The architecture is often obscured by
hemorrhage—a diffuse red color—but very frequently near the periphery, translucent or
more opaque, yellowish points are visible. Rarely, larger, opaque, yellow foci are found in
the gland; these may be softened and purulent in exceptional cases (2, 47, 157).</p>

<p class='c013'>Microscopically, the picture presented by the gland is that of a non-suppurative
lymphadenitis. The peripheral sinuses are markedly distended and the channels through
the gland share in the change (66). The sinuses contain serum, red blood cells, and mononuclear
cells for the most part, but occasionally polymorphonuclear leucocytes are also encountered.
More rarely still, a megalokaryocyte finds its way into the sinus. The most characteristic
feature is the presence of phagocytosed cells,—a picture comparable with
that found in the typhoid lymph node. The nuclei of the phagocytic cells are vesicular and
usually stand out sharply in contrast with the pyknotic nuclei of the included cells. There
is conclusive evidence that the phagocytes arise from the lining cells of the channel wall, as
in typhoid fever, for these cells are frequently in process of division (Fig. <a href='#FIGLIV'>LIV</a>). The blood
vessels of the lymph gland, greatly congested, contain almost exclusively red blood cells.
As a rule, the lymph follicles and the lymph cords take little part in the process. If there
is any change in these structures, it is a rarefication. Occasionally, hemorrhage is encountered
in a follicle or even in a cord, and this hemorrhage may involve not only the cells of
the cord, but its supporting reticular structure, and may form the nucleus of a subsequent
necrotizing or suppurative focus.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>The picture that has been detailed is subject to modification in those cases particularly
where a leucocytic reaction is associated. Then, there may be more polymorphonuclear
leucocytes in the sinuses, and necrotizing foci may be converted into miliary abscesses.</p>

<p class='c013'>The change in the bronchial lymph glands cannot be considered other than an expression
of an aplastic, inflammatory reaction. It finds an analogue especially in diseases like
typhoid fever. The most constant picture includes an edematous, hemorrhagic reaction
in which there is phagocytosis of sieved-out cells by the scavengers generated within the
gland. Where necrosis or suppuration occurs, and this is rare, it may be considered as a
complication.</p>

<p class='c013'>Elsewhere in the body, the lymph glands rarely show the same degree of change as
those of the thorax. The same general picture, however, is present to a greater or lesser
extent, except that extensive necrosis and suppuration have not been encountered.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lymphadenoid tissues of the alimentary canal share in the process only to a minor
extent. In a number of cases, there is no question that the Peyer’s patches and solitary
follicles are hyperplastic. Grossly, they stand out prominently, and are pale pinkish-grey
in color. Histologically, there is hyperplasia, chiefly apparent from the large germinal
centers in the follicles, and a slight distention of the lymph channels. This picture, so commonly
found in every type of general infection, is in no way characteristic of influenza.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Spleen.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The spleen is the seat of the usual manifestations in generalized acute infections. In
no case is the organ markedly involved, although considerable increases in its size may occur
(2, 108, 141, 157, 162). It is not feasible to introduce a detailed discussion of this mild
grade of splenic tumor, for there are natural variations in the size of the spleen and frequently
it is modified in this respect by subsidiary conditions. In every instance the capsule of
the spleen is smooth and there is no acute or chronic perisplenitis attributable to influenza.
The capsule usually retracts slightly and the splenic pulp, in slight excess, is much more frequently
red or garnet than grey in color. Occasionally, the splenic tumor is grey as in
pneumonia. The more minute changes in the organ consist of congestion of the sinuses,
increase of the mononuclear cells of the pulp, and prominence of the germinal centers of the
Malpighian corpuscles (140). Hemorrhages, found occasionally (47), are more frequent
in the pulp, but also occur in the corpuscles.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Bone Marrow.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>One of the clinical features of influenza is a leukopenia, which persists often in the face
of acute pyogenic pulmonary infection (12, 138, 143, etc.). In this series of ninety-five cases,
the vast majority had this type of blood picture, but occasionally a leucocytosis (14) was
demonstrable even during the early part of the disease and in those cases which terminated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>fatally within a period that may be called acute. In almost all instances where fatal termination
was delayed, the leucocyte count ultimately was elevated either with remission
or to a constant high level. The blood studies have not been sufficiently complete to allow
further discussion, though there is reason to believe that these might have yielded interesting
results. The blood changes in this series are similar to those presented in the reports
of the epidemic from other sources.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the majority of cases where the marrow was studied, it was aplastic (12). Occasional,
focal, hemorrhagic lesions of the marrow (47) similar to those discussed below in the skeletal
and parenchymatous systems were encountered and there was an apparent increase in the
number of megalokaryocytes. The usual hyperplasia of the myeloid elements of the marrow
associated with pyogenic change was not present.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>B. LESIONS OF THE BLOOD VESSELS AND ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY</h3>

<p class='c020'>Here, as in the discussion of the involvement of the lymphadenoid tissue, the most outspoken
changes are in the thorax. Frequently thrombi are encountered in the vessels of
the lung (34, 138). This does not include the capillary thrombi associated with damage to
the alveolar walls already discussed. It has not been possible to demonstrate an association
between the hemorrhagic, infarct-like foci in the lung and these vascular complications
(47). The thrombi, histologically, are most frequently propagated, but occasionally
an indication of their etiology is found in a destructive lesion of the vessel wall (19, 47, 50,
108, 156). This arteritis or phlebitis may be embedded either in a pneumonic zone or in
relatively normal lung. The vessel wall may be obscured by a cellular infiltrate throughout
its circumference or only at one point. The cells, on account of karyorrhexis often difficult
to identify, are, partly at least, polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and the thrombus which
forms upon the inflammatory nucleus, as a rule, is fairly rich in these cells (Fig. <a href='#FIGLII'>LII</a>).</p>

<p class='c013'>This vascular lesion may involve either artery or vein and may be found either within
the lung or at distant points. Not infrequently, pulmonary embolus terminates influenza.
One instance of this is incorporated in the group of chronic influenzal cases detailed above
(Fig. <a href='#FIGLIII'>LIII</a>). In this instance, the thrombus originated in the right iliac veins; and, although
no attempt was made to demonstrate the primary vascular lesion, so many similar cases
are recorded (7, 82), and vascular damage is so frequent in this disease, that the hypothesis
attributing pulmonary embolus to a thrombus initiated by a phlebitis is strongly supported.</p>

<p class='c013'>Parenchymatous and skeletal lesions of hemorrhagic type, although variable quantitatively,
are frequent and involve the muscles, the parenchymatous organs,—the adrenal
especially,—and the mucosa of the alimentary canal. They have been described already
with regard to the pleural surface and they may occur in other serous membranes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Only two examples of hemorrhage in the recti muscles<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> were encountered in the ninety-five
autopsies. In other localities this lesion has not only been more frequent but also more
extensive (2, 47, 50, 128, 140, etc.). However, it has been fortunate that the two instances
in this series represent a fresh hemorrhage and the healing lesion, respectively. The fresh
hemorrhage is quite characteristic of Zenker’s necrosis involving muscles. Grossly, it is a
small lesion and does not involve the entire width of the rectus muscle, as may happen, with
a resulting rupture of this structure (12, 162). Microscopically, many of the muscle cells
have lost their striation, are irregularly swollen, and, as fractures in them indicate, are apparently
brittle. Between the muscle fibers and where these are lacking, the predominating
element of exudate is the red blood cell, but there is a considerable amount of fibrin and
also some serum between these cells (Fig. <a href='#FIGLVI'>LVI</a>). The absence of polymorphonuclear
leucocytes is noteworthy. The second example of a muscular lesion occurred in a patient
who died on the twenty-fifth day of the disease. Grossly, this also was a small lesion, although
the muscle fibers at its site were obviously ruptured. Histologically, the lesion is
a healing one. Regeneration of the muscle fibers (47, 156), as illustrated by the formation
of typical spindles, is handicapped by the rapid development of the fibrous scar (Fig. <a href='#FIGLVII'>LVII</a>).
Suppuration had not occurred and this also has been true for the focal, hemorrhagic, inflammatory
processes which were encountered in many different localities throughout the
body.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps the focal hemorrhagic lesions were most frequent in the adrenal gland. Generally,
they were located in the cortex, although medullary hemorrhages were encountered.
The extent of the process varied from minute hemorrhages, associated with necrosis of only
a few cells, to extensive ones involving half of the adrenal. The microscopic examination of
the exudate revealed the same elements and in approximately the same proportions as
described for the similar process in the muscles. Not infrequently, mitotic figures in the
adrenal cells indicated an attempt at repair of a minute damage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hemorrhages in the mucosa of the alimentary canal, including the stomach and intestines,
similar to those so common at the post-mortem table in many different types of acute
infectious disease, are, of course, common in influenza; but, in one case especially, a lesion
was encountered which adds significance to these hemorrhages (47). Here areas of mucosa,
usually round or oval and varying from one-half to two centimeters in diameter, often with
ulceration in their centers, show, microscopically, bacterial emboli in the vessels of the mucosa
with a hemorrhagic effusion which obliterates the architecture of this coat and extends
at some points into the submucosal and muscular layers (Fig. <a href='#FIGLVI'>LVI</a>). Here, the occurrence
of bacterial emboli in association with the lesion suggests that they may be etiologically
related to similar processes in other parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>The above example of hemorrhage in the mucosa of the alimentary canal has seemed of
especial interest, not only for its possible value in explaining the etiology of the lesion here
and elsewhere, but as an interpretation of the findings in Autopsy No. 185, an abstract of
which is appended below. There a hemorrhagic lesion in the wall of the urinary bladder
led to rupture and brought the patient to the surgical clinic of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Autopsy No. 185.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>A white female, aged 46 years, was admitted to the New Haven Hospital on January 4, 1919,
complaining of “cough and headache.” Five days previously she had a “cold” that she was able
to “break up” with quinine and aspirin. The “cold” recurred two days ago, and since then she has
had “frequent chills, aches all over, and feels weak.” Her family and past histories were unimportant.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Physical examination on admission showed congestion of the pharynx. Below the inferior angle
of the scapula on the right, there was dullness, bronchovesicular breath sounds, and a few fine
râles. The examination was otherwise negative. Three days later the signs in the lungs disappeared.
The next day, after an attack of coughing, she complained of something having “burst” within
her abdomen and of generalized abdominal pain. A diagnosis of ruptured bladder was made and
1,400 cubic centimeters of bloody urine were withdrawn by catheter. Immediate operation was decided
upon and the bladder was found a hand’s breadth above the symphysis pubis; the posterior
wall was very thin and presented a tear extending from the trigone upward in the mid line for 7
centimeters. Fully 500 cubic centimeters of clotted blood and urine were removed from the pelvis,
but there was no marked evidence of peritonitis. A permanent mushroom catheter was placed in
the urethra, and the tear was sutured. The abdomen was closed with provision for drainage. The
patient was returned to the ward in doubtful condition.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her temperature at entrance was 104°F., and it fell by lysis to 99°F. just before operation.
After the operation it fell to 97°F., and in a few hours rose to 99°F. Thirty-six hours after operation
she had a chill lasting ten minutes, and her temperature rose to 105°F. in eight hours, when death
occurred. The respirations were thirty per minute until the rupture of the bladder when they rose
to forty per minute and corresponding to the final rise in temperature rose to 60 per minute. The
pulse ran a parallel curve to the temperature, ranging from 100 to 160 per minute.</p>

<p class='c013'>The autopsy was held two hours after death, and the essential findings were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>The body was that of a moderately obese woman. Rigor mortis had not developed, but there
was a distinct heliotropic hue of the face and neck. The recent surgical wound between the symphysis
pubis and umbilicus was in good condition. The peritoneum was slightly dulled in the lower
half of the abdomen, and there was about 100 cubic centimeters of faintly cloudy, blood-tinged,
thin fluid in the pelvis. The left pleural cavity contained about 200 cubic centimeters of slightly
turbid, amber fluid, but the right side was free from fluid. While the pneumonia had not been
prominent clinically, both lungs were found extensively involved by a necrotizing and organizing
bronchopneumonia with purulent bronchitis similar to what has already been described. As the
lesion of the bladder is the distinctive one in this case, and as the other organs show nothing that
has not been described elsewhere, further description will be confined to it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wall of the bladder was thin and soft, and grossly the sutured wound appeared in good condition.
Posteriorly there was a hemorrhagic zone about 3 centimeters in width most marked beneath
the mucosa, but involving all of the coats. The mucosa was superficially ulcerated along this
area, and was covered by a thin, patchy, fibrinous exudate. In addition, there were scattered
beneath the mucosa several smaller hemorrhagic foci, quite distinct from the larger one.</p>

<p class='c013'>Microscopically, one striking feature was the erosion of the mucosa, with hemorrhages most
marked along the line of rupture but occurring elsewhere in the subjacent tissues. This condition
was found in all the sections studied. Another feature was the lack of inflammatory exudate and
the very slight attempt to repair the injury, only a very rare polymorphonuclear cell and fibroblast
being seen. Sections of the peritoneum showed only a patchy deposit of fibrin with a rare polymorphonuclear
cell.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>C. MISCELLANEOUS LESIONS</h3>

<p class='c020'>In this series of cases lesions elsewhere in the body are not sufficiently constant or important
to merit emphasis.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Hemorrhages have been found occasionally in other structures,
especially the testes. The usual cloudy swelling of the parenchymatous organs is,
of course, marked, and in many cases has been associated with actual cellular necrosis both
in the liver and the kidney. Such necroses are usually focal, and occasionally mitotic
figures in the cells of the renal convoluted tubules or in the liver may be a similar expression
of previous damage. Acute nephritis was not found in our series.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The swollen liver
cells often show the bile canaliculi clearly, and this appearance may be associated with a
variable degree of jaundice which has been found frequently, although the explanation of
the jaundice is, in all probability, an hemolysis of the red cells caused by the infecting
microorganisms. The only other lesion encountered and of sufficient importance to mention,
has been the congestion of the membranes of the brain and a swelling of the cerebral
substance, in all probability dependent upon edema. One example of purulent meningitis
was encountered.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> The dilatation of the right side of the heart with a greater or lesser
degree of splanchnic engorgement is such a common feature in acute pulmonary diseases
that it is hardly worthy of detailed discussion.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>A striking feature of influenza is the occurrence of abortion in cases complicated by
pregnancy. Of the ninety-five cases included in this report, twenty-seven were women of
whom three died undelivered (three months, six months, term), three had suffered complete
abortion (one, three months, and two, six months), and one (six months) was in process of
abortion. It is not our purpose to discuss the relation between pregnancy and this complication.
Here it is desirable simply to point out that, although in the non-complicated cases
of influenza, pregnancy does not influence the course of the disease, if pneumonia supervenes,
the mortality for the mother, as well as for the child, is definitely increased (57, 148,
164).</p>

<p class='c013'>A specific placental lesion would be difficult, indeed, to establish since hemorrhage is
a part of the normal process of placental separation. However, the hemorrhagic lesion of
influenza seems a plausible explanation for the frequency of abortions in this disease.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Summary.</i></h4>

<p class='c020'>The most important extrapulmonary lesions in influenza are those of the hematopoietic
and the vascular systems. The first are typical of a general non-suppurative, inflammatory
process, and are characterized in the majority of cases by a picture not unlike that encountered
in typhoid fever, although the hyperplasia of the lymphadenoid tissues, as seen in the
latter disease, is not present. The more important lesions are associated with the vascular
system; phlebitis and arteritis occur, but are not so frequent as hemorrhages in the
skeletal system, in the parenchymatous organs, and in the mucous membranes of the hollow
viscera. These hemorrhagic necroses may be etiologically associated with capillary
bacterial thrombi.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>IV. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE RESPIRATORY LESIONS OF INFLUENZA AND THOSE INITIATED BY THE INHALATION OF POISONOUS GASES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Immediately preceding the advent of the influenza epidemic in New Haven, there had
been completed in this laboratory the experimental studies of the effects of a large number
of different toxic gases upon the respiratory tract. This was begun with the support of the
Bureau of Mines, and subsequently, after the formation of the Chemical Warfare Service,
the work received the support, not only of this branch of the Army, but also of the Surgeon
General’s Office. Exceptional opportunities for animal experimentation were offered.
Every stage of the inflammatory process in the respiratory tract was studied, from the most
acute, a few hours after the exposure of the animal to a high concentration of gas, to the
very chronic types that resulted from sublethal concentrations and led to lesions encountered
at the sacrifice of the animals many months later.</p>

<p class='c013'>The criticism will unquestionably be introduced, that with the anatomical picture of
the respiratory lesions initiated by irritating gases freshly in mind, an analogy between them
and those of the pulmonary lesions of influenza may not be impartially drawn. However,
such fundamental and striking similarities exist between the two processes (128) that the
argument is simplified.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>A. THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE VERSUS THE SYSTEMIC CAPACITY TO COMPENSATE</h3>

<p class='c020'>Symmers (141) and Oberndorfer (108) have already likened the influenzal pulmonary
complications to plague pneumonia, and it is quite possible that others will find fundamental
similarities with other fulminating, inflammatory reactions. Inflammation, a series of
processes manifested after injury by a tissue which still retains its viability, is modified by
another important factor usually neglected; namely, the state of the host. As a consequence,
the inflammatory reaction might readily have similar manifestations even though
the primary exciting agents are diverse. This has been amply demonstrated for many different
reactive processes, and still it may be considered as a challenge for those who are of
the opinion that specific bacterial agents necessarily produce characteristic anatomical
manifestations. Consider the state of knowledge of the various reactions to the tubercle
bacillus before this microorganism was isolated; and then bear in mind that we are dealing
here with a disease whose causative agent, despite the present uncertainty regarding its
specific nature, produces a lesion that paves the way for the invasion of the respiratory
tract by many different organisms. The extent of the reaction may depend upon the systemic
capacity to compensate, as well as upon the degree of primary damage in a specific
system of organs. Unquestionably, these two factors must take their places in the balance,
the opposite pan of which contains the one or the other secondary bacillary invader.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Scientific medicine has reached that evolutionary period where, in addition to the specific
infecting microorganism, associated etiological factors find an important place in the
interpretation of a disease. More and more attention is being directed toward the latter
factors and the rôle they play in respiratory infections. Many different factors open the
pulmonary portal for organisms and, in this way, terminate by a serious respiratory inflammatory
complication what otherwise might have been a relatively mild disease. In the
past two years this has been demonstrated for measles.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the above reasons, not only the immediate action but the complications and sequelæ,
too, of the inhalation of irritating gases by normal healthy animals, emphasize
themselves as a framework for a more comprehensive interpretation of respiratory disease
in general.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>B. THE PRIMARY INJURY</h3>

<p class='c020'>With few exceptions, the gases studied have their most marked effect upon the respiratory
tract. They differ, however, in the localization of the lesions and in the extent of the
damage. For instance, mustard gas, in high concentrations, has a necrotizing effect upon
the entire respiratory tract even to the pulmonary parenchyma itself. Inhaled in a more
dilute form it involves the larynx and the trachea and has spent itself before the lung is
reached. With phosgene, the opposite is true. The upper respiratory tract is only slightly
involved. The outspoken lesions involve the bronchioles, the ducti alveolares, and extend
to the alveolar walls of the lung. Chlorine, while it produces a less severe lesion of
the upper respiratory tract, extends more often through all of the ramifications of the
tracheal tree to the lung.</p>

<p class='c013'>With vital stains (trypan blue), it may be readily demonstrated that these gases kill
the epithelium of the respiratory tract and extend through this superficial cellular coat to
the deeper tissues of the bronchiolar wall and to the lung tissue, killing it entirely, just as a
corrosive chemical destroys the wall of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c013'>When chlorine and phosgene reach the lung, an intense reactive process follows immediately.
The congestive changes, the hemorrhage into the pulmonary parenchyma both
in the alveoli and in the subpleural and interstitial tissues, and the albuminous rich, serous
exudates occupy the foreground of the acute picture and are associated clinically with intense
cyanosis, great dyspnœa, hemorrhage, bronchorrhea, and also with pulmonary and subcutaneous
interstitial emphysema. The microscope reveals a hyalinization of the walls
of the bronchioles or ducti alveolares which are distended during this acute period and form
a picture that is very unusual in the more frequent types of respiratory inflammation. It
shows also a hyalinization of the alveolar walls, usually those in direct continuity with the
larger air passages. The interstitial edema and hemorrhage, often perivascular in distribution,
is only overshadowed by the thick, almost colloid-like material within the alveolus
itself. Fibrin stains at this stage show this exudative element in surprisingly large amounts.
Fibrin not only covers the alveolar wall, but crosses this structure and often forms intracapillary
plugs. In fact, besides the red blood cells, the serum and the fibrin, one often
sees, not only an excess of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the vessels of the lung, but these
appear in process of migration within a few hours after the animal has been exposed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Animals surviving this stage often succumb later with a typical pneumonic process.
Although frequently pseudolobar, the process may be lobar in extent, and as time goes on
more definite lobular involvement is frequently encountered. With the localization of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>inflammatory process, the general edema, congestion and milder reactions in other portions
of the lung tend to subside, and may be entirely absent in a few days. The clinical picture,
in the experimental animal at least, also assumes a more typical expression of respiratory
infection,—leucocytosis, chlorine retention, etc., appear. Often the pneumonias, both
lobar and lobular, are complicated, grossly, by softening, and histologically, by necrotization
of the bronchiolar and alveolar walls. Recrudescence of the active pulmonary infection
is not uncommon, and perhaps is associated with these focal necrotizing areas.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>C. THE TENDENCY TO ORGANIZATION OF BRONCHIOLAR AND ALVEOLAR EXUDATES</h3>

<p class='c020'>The sequelæ after exposure to gas may be markedly delayed. They occur, not only
in animals which have exhibited characteristic acute symptoms, but also, and especially
with phosgene, where no serious immediate clinical effects followed exposure to the gases.
They are dependent upon the fact that the pneumonic process has a very striking tendency
to undergo organization, a process which involves not only the exudate in the alveoli, but
also that within the bronchioles. The organizing process may be present in both these
portions of the lung or may be confined to the bronchiole alone, and lead to a progressive
interference with the ingress and egress of alveolar air, so that atelectasis and emphysema
become permanent, and in turn lead to narrowing of the vascular bed, ultimately producing
right-sided cardiac decompensation. Bronchiectases also occur; they may be tubular,
associated with organization of the pneumonic process in their vicinity, or saccular if
death has not followed the destruction of the bronchiolar wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>Compare this picture with that of influenzal pneumonia and its sequelæ; in both there
is, first the acute diffuse involvement of the lung, initiated by, or occurring simultaneously
with, an acute tracheobronchitis and presenting clinically dyspnœa, cyanosis, blood-stained,
abundant sputum, and even interstitial emphysema; next, the tendency for the
pneumonic process to localize and to necrotize; and finally, if the acute period is survived,
organization of the pneumonic and bronchiolar exudates with resulting bronchiolitis and
bronchiectasis. With even more minute comparison, the resemblance is sustained. The
initial or early dilatation of the ducti alveolares, so characteristic in gas poisoning, also
occupies the foreground of the histological picture in influenza. These dilated structures are
the more prominent on account of the red, ribbon-like strands that cover the surface and
often involve the walls. Similar necrotization, varying in its depth even to involve the
whole of the alveolar walls, occurs in both of these conditions. Similar hemorrhages in the
early stage, rupture of the alveolar wall with interstitial and subcutaneous emphysema,
necrotization, gangrene, and organization in the same localities, characterize the two lesions,
and are not found with the same uniformity in any other type of respiratory disease.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>D. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRACHEA AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS AS A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM AGAINST INFECTION OF THE PULMONARY PARENCHYMA</h3>

<p class='c020'>In gas poisoning it has been demonstrated that the initial damage to the epithelium of
the larger air passages is followed by an invasion of the pulmonary parenchyma by the
bacteria of the mouth. Repeated cultures from the mouth before the exposure of the
animal to gas have been followed by the recovery of the same organisms, including the pneumococci,
the streptococci, the staphylococci, and a gram-negative, hemoglobinophilic, small
bacillus from the pneumonic lung. They find their way into the lung after the destruction
or incapacitation of the protective mechanism (70) of the upper respiratory tract,—into a
lung which has been so damaged by the irritative gas that bacteria innocuous in the normal
pharynx now find a favorable medium for their development. The inflammatory reaction
which develops into pneumonia, perhaps necrotizing, perhaps later organizing, can only
be explained by the combined action of the corrosive gas and the organisms saprophytic
in the normal mouth, but now pathogenic in varying degrees in the lung whose vital reactions
have either been inhibited or impaired by the gas.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>V. PECULIARITIES OF THE HISTOLOGY OF INFLUENZAL PNEUMONIA</h2>
</div>
<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>A. THE EXTENT OF THE INITIAL PULMONARY LESION</h3>

<p class='c020'>One of the features differentiating the pneumonic process in influenza from the usual
types of inflammation of the lung, is diffuseness (90). In the early cases especially, or in
cases which terminate fatally at an early period, both lungs are often involved, and, on histological
examination, only a small portion of the pulmonary parenchyma is found unaffected.
The exudate, largely acellular, presents serum as its most conspicuous feature.
The picture is one of a patchy pneumonia with intermediary areas of what might be called
edema, although fibrin is often demonstrable in the coagulated, albuminous material. So
little attention has been paid to earlier stages of the usual types of pneumonia, for example
lobar, that it is impossible to say whether or not diffuse involvement of the pulmonary
parenchyma initiates the process which later becomes localized in one or more lobes. The
initial edema of influenzal pneumonia is the expression of a widespread irritation. If the injury
has not extended deeply, the edema may disappear within a relatively short time, and
exfoliated lining cells fill the alveoli; those remaining in their normal position are frequently
in process of division (Fig. <a href='#FIGXLVII'>XLVII</a>). It is conceivable—and the view has already been announced—that
this edema is a disseminating factor and perhaps responsible for the diffuseness
of the pneumonic process which may follow. If the fluid is simply a serous exudate, it
may play no essential rôle in the severe acute symptoms manifested by these patients, for
it has been shown, both in the experimental lesions induced by pulmonary irritating gases
and by pulmonary irrigation through which extensive artificial edema of the lungs may be
attained, that the presence of fluid in the lung in itself is not harmful (161).</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>B. THE HEMORRHAGIC EXUDATE</h3>

<p class='c020'>Another striking feature of the inflammatory process in this disease is the extensive
hemorrhagic exudate expressed clinically in the fresh, red blood of the abundant sputum. In
the tissues the blood is always fairly well preserved. It may be scattered diffusely through
the cellular exudate (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXIV'>XXIV</a>) or so abundantly that the area resembles an infarct (Fig.
<a href='#FIGXXV'>XXV</a>). These hemorrhagic foci, which vary considerably in size, are found not only in
the cases that terminate fatally within a few days, but may occur at any time during the
acute manifestation of the disease. They are an exaggerated form of red hepatization and
it is difficult to see how such red foci could ever change to areas of grey pneumonia. It is
a widely accepted statement, in textbooks of Pathology at least, that the stage of red hepatization
in pneumonia follows the period of engorgement and precedes the grey form. This
interpretation is open to question concerning the lesions that are encountered in influenza,
as well as in those that are seen after gas inhalation. Unquestionably, in the stage of engorgement
the lung has a red appearance, enhanced by the acellular, serofibrinous exudate
in the alveoli through which the greatly congested vessels are seen. At this stage, the lung
has a translucency on gross examination, which is not the case when the cellular content of
the alveoli is increased. This picture is not the one spoken of most commonly as red hepatization;
for, although it appears as a relatively red lung in the gross, difficulty is encountered
in its histological correlation, for the exudate is composed, not of red cells, but largely of
serum and fibrin. The red color may persist even when numerous polymorphonuclear
leucocytes and desquamated alveolar wall cells are within the alveoli, the walls of which are
markedly engorged. Later, as the circulation in the pneumonic zone is impaired, the alveolar
exudate determines the tone of the gross color, and a considerable number of red blood
cells may be overshadowed by the larger percentage of white ones.</p>

<p>FIG. XLIII. THE ALVEOLAR WALLS ARE THIN AND THE EXUDATE OF RED BLOOD CELLS AND DESQUAMATED EPITHELIUM IS IN PART HYALINIZED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The advent of red blood cells where grossly the exudate is red can hardly be explained
by the simple process of diapedesis. Indeed, there is ample evidence that they escape by
rhexis through lesions of the vascular wall. This phenomenon cannot be demonstrated in
areas where a compact mass of red cells obliterates the alveolar space (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXV'>XXV</a>), but in
the less firmly consolidated alveoli where red blood cells predominate (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXVI'>XXVI</a>) the
picture of the alveolar wall is very instructive. The capillaries may be prominent and contain
red cells almost exclusively. Often the epithelium of the air space is exfoliated so that
there is nothing to minimize the prominence of the engorged vessels. These capillaries,
covered by such a delicate wall that rupture seems imminent, may protrude like saccular
aneurysms (101) into the alveolar space (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXVI'>XXVI</a>). In all probability, these sacs do
rupture and this result would be one explanation for the escape of large numbers of red
blood cells. In several instances such a picture was encountered, where with little reaction
at the point of rupture, red cells within the vessel were continuous with an accumulation of
similar cells in the alveolus. Further evidence for such rupture is offered where the vessel
is collapsed. Here there is accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the area of
destruction in contrast to the well preserved red corpuscles in the remainder of the vessel
(Fig. <a href='#FIGXXVI'>XXVI</a>). The above pictures may be utilized in the interpretation of the outspoken
foci of red hepatization which may assume infarct-like proportions. As has been said, it
is impossible to conceive that these hemorrhagic areas where the alveoli are packed with
red cells ever change to a grey type of consolidation. Consequently, it seems more probable
that the color of red hepatization in the usual types of pneumonia depends upon the
marked engorgement of the vessels seen through a relatively acellular, transparent, serofibrinous,
alveolar mass and not upon the number of red cells in the exudate.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>C. THE APLASTIC EXUDATE</h3>

<p class='c020'>The absence of cellular elements in the alveolar exudate is frequently observed in influenzal
pneumonia (Figs. <a href='#FIGXXI'>XXI</a>, <a href='#FIGXXII'>XXII</a>, <a href='#FIGXXIII'>XXIII</a>). This picture has been reproduced experimentally
in animals which have been rendered aplastic with benzol, especially with reference
to their myeloid elements (160). Pneumonia produced by intratracheal insufflation
is more rapidly fatal in aplastic animals, and it is conceivable that the absence of cellular
reaction is an explanation for the lack of resistance demonstrated by the high mortality
of influenzal pneumonia. Frequently the fibrinoserous mass scattered diffusely throughout
the lung is rich in bacteria. In the absence of cells of the polymorphonuclear series,
the bacterial development seems to be unrestricted. The aplastic exudate is associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>clinically with an absence of a myeloid reaction in the peripheral circulation. The leucocytic
count may be definitely decreased, even though the tissues have been invaded by pyogenic
organisms to which the usual response is a definite leucocytosis. The only explanation
is that the myeloid structures have been injured, probably by the unknown virus of the
disease.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>D. THE HYALINE NECROSIS OF THE PULMONARY TISSUE</h3>

<p class='c020'>The hyalinization of the epithelium lining the ducti alveolares (47, 48) also merits
special attention (Figs. <a href='#FIGV'>V</a>, <a href='#FIGXV'>XV</a>, <a href='#FIGXVI'>XVI</a>). This process may extend through the wall of the
duct and is often seen in the alveolar walls throughout the involved lung. The entire alveolar
wall may be homogeneous in appearance, but, occasionally, the thrombus alone, which
has formed in its vessels (41), presents this change (Fig. <a href='#FIGXVII'>XVII</a>). The alveolar as well as
the bronchiolar wall is thickened by a homogeneous material in which cell-body and exudate
cannot be differentiated. This acute necrosis, as has been mentioned, is encountered
in gas poisoning but is unusual in other known types of respiratory infection. Doubtless,
it is a precursor to the more destructive lesions commonly found in later stages of the
disease—abscesses which extend through the bronchiolar walls (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXI'>XXXI</a>), necrotizing
areas of pneumonia in which huge clumps of bacteria are found (Fig. <a href='#FIGXXXII'>XXXII</a>), and true
gangrene (Figs. <a href='#FIGXXXIII'>XXXIII</a>, <a href='#FIGXXXIV'>XXXIV</a>, <a href='#FIGXXXV'>XXXV</a>). The destruction of the alveolar wall in the
early stages of the disease plays a causal rôle in the production of subcutaneous emphysema
(Figs. <a href='#FIGXVIII'>XVIII</a> and <a href='#FIGXIX'>XIX</a>). This important phase of the histological change in influenzal
pneumonia has received but little attention and, with one or two exceptions, is not mentioned
in the literature (8, 162).</p>

<p class='c013'>In the interpretation of this necrotization, the only helpful analogy is offered by the
acute respiratory lesions following the inhalation of poisonous gases. With the aid of vital
stains, it has been demonstrated that chlorine quickly initiates necrosis due to the direct
action of the gas. Since necrosis also occurs with phosgene,—in the decomposition of which
hydrochloric acid is probably liberated,—there is presumptive evidence that the halogen
is responsible for the process. Studies are now in progress to determine the relation of the
acid-producing properties of the different strains of organisms to the type and fate of the
pneumonic exudate.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>E. THE ORGANIZATION PROCESS</h3>

<p class='c020'>The similarity between the acute lesions of influenzal pneumonia and those following
the inhalation of poisonous gases led to the prediction, in the early studies, that if the process
were not terminated by death, the bronchiolar and alveolar changes would not result
in a restoration of the tissue to normal, but in an organization which would in its turn bring
about mechanical changes in the pulmonary tissue. This prediction has been fulfilled;
obliterating bronchiolitis (Figs. <a href='#FIGXI'>XI</a> and <a href='#FIGXLVIII'>XLVIII</a>), bronchiectasis (Figs. <a href='#FIGL'>L</a> and <a href='#FIGXII'>XII</a>), and organizing
pneumonia (47, 92, 156, 162) (Figs. <a href='#FIGXXXIX'>XXXIX</a>, <a href='#FIGXL'>XL</a>, <a href='#FIGXLI'>XLI</a>, <a href='#FIGXLIV'>XLIV</a>, <a href='#FIGXLV'>XLV</a>) have been
encountered despite the fact that the time interval for fatalities from extraneous or subsidiary
causes has been short.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Resolution of the exudate in pneumonia, with the restoration of the tissue to normal,
is a result at such variance with the usual fate of an inflammatory exudate, that it has
attracted a great deal of attention. Perhaps the most striking results of the study of this
subject have been published recently by Kline (69). Arguing from previous experiments
(70) in which it was demonstrated that the circulation of the pneumonic lung is impaired,
and that for this reason sufficient serum cannot reach the exudate to inhibit the proteolytic
action of leucocytic ferments, Kline introduced normal serum into the consolidated lung
by the tracheal route, and showed conclusively that this resulted in an organization of the
alveolar exudate. This, of course, might explain resolution, but it is difficult to see without
further study how serum can reach the exudate to inhibit autolysis, and in this way stimulate
organization, in one case of pneumonia and not in another.</p>

<p class='c013'>Comparison with certain processes in other portions of the body suggest the nature of
this stimulus to organization in pneumonia. For example, it is well known that epithelial
necrosis of the liver that results from chloroform is followed by a restitution of the organ
to normal. On the other hand, if the liver necrosis is produced by a chemical agent plus a
bacterial one, the destructive lesion not only involves the liver cell, but extends to the
framework of the organ and terminates in a cirrhosis. Unquestionably, the difference between
the reaction after the chemical alone and that after chemical plus bacterial injury is
a more extensive destruction in the latter case resulting in a stimulation of all the elements
of the organ, including liver cell, connective tissue, and blood vessel. The connective tissue
and vascular elements have a greater capacity to regenerate than has the liver cell; consequently,
granulations form which impede the less active reparative process of the hepatic
cell. If this comparison be applied to the pulmonary changes in influenza and after the
inhalation of poisonous gases, it will be seen that in both processes the initial damage is
extensive, as has been indicated in the discussion of necrotization. Where the lesion is
superficial, tracheal, bronchial, and alveolar epithelia rapidly regenerate and restore the
injured surface. Where, however, the lesions are more extensive, alveolar and bronchiolar
exudates are transformed into granulation tissue, even though the epithelium may manifest
unusual activity in its attempt to repair a denuded area.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>VI. INFECTION AS A POSSIBLE ETIOLOGICAL FACTOR FOR MALIGNANT NEW GROWTHS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It is rare to see such activity on the part of the epithelium as that frequently encountered
in influenza. The alveoli may be lined by newly formed cubical cells (Figs. <a href='#FIGIV'>IV</a>, <a href='#FIGXI'>XI</a>,
<a href='#FIGXLVII'>XLVII</a>), and mitotic figures in the injured bronchiolar lining occur in abundance. This
might lead to the supposition that, if the epithelium were restricted in its path of development,
it would pile up to form a typical nest, just as the epithelium at the edge of a healing
chronic ulcer of the skin may pile up and extend fairly deep into the tissue. In a number of
cases, epithelial proliferation has been so extensive that it could not be differentiated histologically
from an invasive, malignant neoplasm (47) (Figs. <a href='#FIGXLVIII'>XLVIII</a> and <a href='#FIGXLIX'>XLIX</a>). There
is no reason to believe that malignancy might not result from the continuous stimulation of
the epithelium to proliferate, in the chronic inflammatory process of the lung in influenza,
just as chronic infection in the lung of a mouse results in a much higher percentage of spontaneous
neoplasms of the respiratory tract in this species (132) than in those animals where
chronic pulmonary inflammatory processes are uncommon. It will be interesting, indeed,
to see whether, as a late manifestation, there is an increase in the number of now relatively
rare epithelial new growths in the respiratory tract of man.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>VII. THE BACTERIOLOGY OF INFLUENZAL PNEUMONIA</h2>
</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>A. ORGANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH INFLUENZAL PNEUMONIA</h3>

<p class='c020'>Certain conclusions may be drawn from the literature on the bacteriology of the
respiratory lesions associated with influenza. All reports show that a few organisms have
been found more or less constantly in influenza and influenzal pneumonia: the pneumococcus
group, the streptococci (hemolytic, non-hemolytic, pandemicus, etc.) and the
Pfeiffer bacillus. They may occur alone, together, or with less frequently found organisms.
Among the latter, the staphylococcus, the Micrococcus catarrhalis, Bacillus pneumoniæ
(Friedlander), diphtheroids, and undetermined organisms, all have been reported (2, 48,
62, 67, 68, 92).</p>

<p class='c013'>Another feature has been the variation of the predominating organism, or organisms, in
different localities, and in the same locality at different times. For example, Wolbach
(162) at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, demonstrated the Pfeiffer bacillus at autopsy in
twenty-three out of twenty-eight cases. In fourteen, it was in pure culture. Keegan (67)
at Chelsea, Massachusetts, also found it in eighty-two per cent of the lungs at necropsy, in
thirty-one per cent of which it was in pure culture. MacCallum (92), working at Camp
Lee, Virginia, found the pneumococcus, Type IV, the predominating organism and rarely the
Pfeiffer bacillus. “At the Johns Hopkins Hospital similar methods revealed no influenza
bacilli whatever.” At Camp Dix, New Jersey, however, MacCallum found the Pfeiffer
bacillus in every case. At Camp Grant, Illinois, Hirsch and McKinney (60) state that the
epidemic was due to a virulent strain of pneumococcus and that the Pfeiffer bacillus played
no rôle. At the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Ely and co-workers (37) did not find the Pfeiffer
bacillus; they attributed the epidemic to the hemolytic streptococcus. Goodpasture (48),
working at the same hospital as Keegan, reports that the bacteria found in December,
1918, and January, 1919, were different from those found in the early months of the epidemic,
inasmuch as in the latter group the hemolytic streptococcus was found in one hundred per
cent of the cases and the Pfeiffer bacillus in twelve per cent. The foreign literature shows
similar variations in the bacteriology.</p>

<p class='c013'>The organisms associated with influenzal pneumonia are the so-called “mouth organisms.”
They are not only found in the mouths and upper air passages of the influenza
patients, but also in those of normal individuals. This points to the fact that the bacteria
of the mouth have gained access to the lung, probably already injured by a primary agent,
in sufficient numbers to bring about a serious inflammatory process. In this connection
it is of interest to note the relatively high frequency of the mouth organisms, pneumococcus,
Types III and IV, in influenzal pneumonia as compared to the less frequent mouth inhabitants,
Types I and II, which are responsible for two-thirds of the cases of true lobar
pneumonia (5, 45, 92, 121).</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Only the eighty-two cases at the New Haven Hospital are included in the following report.
Routine post-mortem cultures were taken from blood, lung, serous fluid wherever
present, and exudates from the trachea and bronchi in the later cases. Blood and serous
fluids were cultured into neutral infusion broth and plated on blood agar after twelve to
thirty-six hours’ incubation. Lung and bronchial cultures were streaked on blood agar plates
and for the last third of the series on Avery’s oleate media. Cultures were examined on each
successive day and were discarded only after one week. Undoubtedly, we have failed to
find B. influenzæ in many of the earlier cases because of lack of familiarity with the organism,
of variations in its morphology (33), and of unsuitable culture media. The organisms
tabulated below include only those determined by cultural methods; those found by direct
smears or in histopathological preparations are not considered. (See Table No. <a href='#TABLEI'>I</a>.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>B. THE RELATION OF THE TYPE OF ORGANISM TO PLEURAL INVOLVEMENT</h3>

<p class='c020'>The hemolytic streptococcus has been found frequently in association with purulent
pleural effusions in influenza, Thomas (146), Stone and Swift (138), Ely et al (37); and
Goodpasture (48) has suggested an etiologic relationship between the type of effusion and
the infecting organism in influenza, as has been brought forward for the similar post-measles
empyema in the army camps. At the New Haven Hospital the Streptococcus hemolyticus
was found frequently in non-fatal empyema. However, at post-mortem examination the
frequency of this organism in pleural effusions of various types was no greater than that
of several other organisms, but it occurred in the only two cases of frank empyema of this
series. (See Table No. <a href='#TABLEII'>II</a>.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>C. THE RELATION OF DIFFERENT ORGANISMS TO THE TYPE OF PNEUMONIA</h3>

<p class='c020'>Various observers have emphasized the types of organism associated with different
gross and microscopic manifestations of influenzal pneumonia. Pfeiffer described the peribronchial
type with purulent bronchitis, from which the influenza bacillus was isolated, and
the same association has been noted by MacCallum (92), Wolbach (162), Wegelin (156),
Dietrich (34), and others. Opie et al (110), however, in a series from which B. influenzæ
was isolated in over eighty-five per cent of the necropsies rarely found this picture. Wolbach
states that the gross anatomical picture in influenzal pneumonia is similar to that
following measles, from which a hemolytic streptococcus has been isolated in a high percentage
of cases. MacCallum (93) classified this type as interstitial pneumonia. It is interesting
to note that interstitial pneumonia has been rare in many localities where the hemolytic
streptococcus has been prevalent during the past year. Stone and Swift (138) state
that “despite the prevalence of the streptococcus at necropsy, only eight instances of so-called
interstitial pneumonia were found in a series of fifty-five cases,” and Goodpasture
(48) failed to find a single example in a series of sixteen cases. The pneumococci Types
I and II, frequently encountered in the usual forms of lobar pneumonia, have been found
exceptionally in this epidemic. Type II, however, has been reported (67, 107) present in
about the same proportion as in true lobar pneumonia (5). Chickering and Park (25)
described a series of cases of pneumonia due to the staphylococcus characterized by multiple
miliary abscesses. Necrotization and abscess formation, however, have been striking
features of the pathology of this epidemic, even when the staphylococcus has not been
demonstrable. Recently Wadsworth (154) demonstrated experimentally that organization
in pneumonia does not result from the pneumococcus or the staphylococcus alone, but
only follows when both organisms are associated. On the contrary, Blanton and Irons
(12) found that “there was no difference to be made out in the nature of the process caused
by the streptococcus, pneumococcus, or influenza bacillus.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The type of the pneumonic process, as well as the invading organism, has varied widely
in different localities. From the foregoing brief survey, it will be seen that before the associations
suggested above can be proven, much more definite evidence must be presented.</p>

<p class='c013'>An attempt has been made to correlate the bacteriological findings in this series with
the distribution and type of pneumonic process. These are tabulated in Table III. It will
be seen at a glance that no relationship is demonstrable between the type of single or associated
organisms and the distribution of the pneumonia, whether it is lobar, pseudolobar,
peribronchial or lobular and whether acute fulminating, necrotizing or organizing. (See
Table No. <a href='#TABLEIII'>III</a>.)</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c018'>D. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</h3>

<p class='c020'>The confusion which exists in associating different bacterial types with well defined and
characteristic anatomical lesions is true, not only for the disease as it occurs spontaneously
in man, but also for its reproduction in experimental animals. A review of the literature
teaches that not all of the factors concerned in producing the different anatomical types are
known.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pertinent experimental studies were reported recently by Blake and Cecil from the
Army Medical School in Washington. One cubic centimeter of a very virulent pneumococcus
(M. L. D. for a mouse in forty-eight hours equals one-millionth of 1 cubic centimeter)
inoculated in monkeys through the skin of the neck into the trachea just beneath the larynx
has uniformly produced a lobar pneumonia, clinically as well as anatomically the nearest
experimental approach to spontaneous lobar pneumonia of man. This work indicates, not
only the possible importance the species may play, but also points to the rôle of the infecting
organism which, when sufficiently virulent, incites a characteristic reaction even when
inoculated in a minimal quantity into the trachea as distinct from the bronchioles or
lung tissue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pneumonia unassociated with a simultaneous or preliminary incapacitation of the
mechanism of the upper respiratory tract, differs from the pulmonary lesions encountered
after measles, gas poisoning, influenza, etc., and those experimentally produced by intrabronchial
insufflations. In the lobar type the virulence of the infecting organism, combined
perhaps with species variation,—implying as this does different capacities for reaction on the
part of the host,—seems to be the fundamental principle. It remains to be determined
whether other organisms of equal virulence with that of the pneumococcus are capable of
producing characteristic anatomical reactions when inoculated in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the other group, where there is not only a free ingress to the pulmonary parenchyma
by the bacteria of the mouth, but where there is, in all probability, also a simultaneous or
preliminary pulmonary damage furnishing a proper medium for relatively innocuous organisms,
the lesion of response will surely depend upon other factors as much as upon the
infecting organism. Among these obscure factors, the most important, unquestionably,
is the extent of the damage to the lung tissue before the entry of the organisms, or simultaneously
with it, into this area. The systemic capacity to compensate also must be
considered.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>VIII. CONCLUSIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The etiology of influenza is unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>The portal of entry of the inciting cause is likewise undetermined.</p>

<p class='c013'>The respiratory lesions, whether primary or secondary, are responsible for the high
mortality of the disease.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lesions of the respiratory tract peculiar to this disease and most frequently encountered
are:</p>

<p class='c021'>An acute tracheobronchitis associated with diffuse involvement of the pulmonary
parenchyma.</p>

<p class='c022'>Hyalinization of the epithelium of the air passages, and necrosis of the alveolar walls
with extensive interstitial emphysema and occasionally with pneumothorax.</p>

<p class='c022'>Dilatation of the terminal bronchioles.</p>

<p class='c022'>Aplastic serofibrinous, and hemorrhagic, pneumonic exudates.</p>

<p class='c022'>Necrotizing and organizing bronchiolitis, and pneumonia: lobar, lobular, peribronchial,
interstitial.</p>

<p class='c022'>The sequelæ—obliterating bronchiolitis and bronchiolectasis.</p>

<p class='c022'>Proliferation of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium.</p>

<p class='c020'>The extrarespiratory lesions of influenza are neither constant nor characteristic. Irrespective
of localization, they have the same fundamental pathology characterized by:</p>

<p class='c015'>Vascular damage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hemorrhage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Organization with or without infection.</p>

<p class='c013'>A basis for the interpretation of the respiratory lesions of influenza is offered by the
analogous changes in the respiratory tract initiated by the inhalation of poisonous gases.</p>

<p class='c013'>The respiratory lesions are dependent primarily upon the damage produced by the true
etiological agent and the systemic capacity to compensate, and only secondarily upon invasion
by the bacterial flora of the mouth and inspired air.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The history of the epidemics of influenza cannot but impress one with the difficulties of medical progress. Beyond the
fact that the descriptions of the epidemics are such that the disease is recognizable as being the same, there is little of real
value in the literature until the beginning of the 19th century.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the 18th century the infectious nature of the malady had been recognized. The results of study in the first half of the
19th century are shown in the literature of the epidemic of 1847–49. In it, exceptionally good clinical descriptions and epidemilogical
studies are published. In the next forty years great strides were made in Pathology and in the essentially new
science of Bacteriology. With those two aids in the study of infectious disease, it is only reasonable to expect an increase in
knowledge of influenza after the epidemic of 1889–90. Such is the fact and a comprehensive review of both the Bacteriology
and Pathology of this disease is offered in Nothnagel’s Specielle Pathologie, 1896, Bd. IV, by O. Leichtenstern.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Early in the epidemic, Nicolle (106) and his co-workers described a filterable virus as the probable etiological agent in
influenza. Several investigators have corroborated this work. Chief of these are: Gibson, Bowman, and Connor (46);
Bradford, Bashford, and Wilson (16). The latter investigators independently isolated a filterable virus which may be
cultivated by the Noguchi method and which, when inoculated into monkeys, produces a general reaction with specific respiratory
lesions which, they think, are comparable to those of man in influenza. While these results must be confirmed, they
offer greater promise than any other.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. A marked fibrinous exudate in the lower trachea with the formation of a pseudomembrane was noted by Oberndorfer
(108), Lubarsch (19), Coray (28), Borst (15), and Schmorl (128). Schmorl studied the bacteria from the trachea and found
in sections streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci, but not B. influenzæ or B. diphtheriæ.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Simmonds (131), Bernhardt and Meyer (19) note that perichondritis may be present, but do not give a detailed description
of the lesion. Gruber and Schädel (50) found this perichondritis to be associated with abscess formation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Two examples of fresh endocarditis are reported by Malloch (95) and one by Dietrich (34), all of which were due to B.
influenzæ. Acute myocarditis was observed by Blanton and Irons (12) and Gruber and Schädel (50). Glaus and Fritzsche
(47) report a case with multiple hemorrhages, necrosis, and leucocytic infiltration of the heart muscle and also one of
Zenker’s degeneration of the myocardium. Cases of both myocarditis and endocarditis are included by Leichtenstern (82)
in a review of the epidemic of 1889–1890.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. The picture is not unlike that of the interstitial pneumonia after measles as described by MacCallum (93).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. Pneumothorax as a complication following influenzal pneumonia is mentioned in association with marked emphysema
in the epidemic of 1889–90 by Leichtenstern (82). It has been found by X-ray examination in two cases of interstitial emphysema
by Berkley and Coffen (8) and also has occurred at Camp Dix according to the report of Synnot and Clark (143).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The rarity of empyema has been commented upon by LeCount (78) and Torry and Grosch (149). The condition was
found in a small number of cases by Wegelin (156), Malloch (95), Lyon (90), Chickering (25), and Thomas (146), while
Goodpasture (48) described it in eleven out of sixteen cases of streptococcus hemolyticus pneumonia.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Fibrinopurulent pericarditis has been described by Simmonds (131), Stone and Swift (138), Lyon (90), Fildes et al (40),
Jaffé (66), Glaus and Fritzsche (47).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. The types of consolidation described as having been encountered at the post-mortem table apparently vary somewhat
with the locality and the interpretation of the observers. The lobar type has been frequently found by Opie et al (110),
Wollstein and Goldbloom (164), Stone and Swift (138), and others. The pseudolobar pneumonia has been mentioned by
Abrahams et al (2), Keegan (67), and Speares (135), while the peribronchial type has been well described by Hubschman,
Glaus and Fritzsche (47), and MacCallum (92). Lobular pneumonia has been noted by all observers. The type of consolidation
in this series has been tabulated in relation to the inflammatory reaction.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. No particular search was made for such lesions until the epidemic was nearly half over. At that time word was received
from Camp Devens that hemorrhagic lesions in the rectus muscle were being found. Thereafter, the recti were examined
with care.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Abscesses supervening upon the rectus hemorrhages are reported by Beals, Blanton and Eisendrath (7), and by Glaus
and Fritzsche (47). Generalized abscesses are reported by the latter and by Dietrich (34). Abrahams, Hallows and French
(2) report subcutaneous abscesses; Beals, Blanton and Eisendrath, abscesses of the kidneys.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The sinuses of the head and middle ears were examined in a number of cases with negative findings. Suppuration of
these areas is, however, reported by others.</p>

<p class='c013'>Stone and Swift (138) found pus in the sphenoidal sinus in 68 per cent of their cases with pneumococci, streptococci and
B. influenzæ present. Wolbach (162) found twenty cases of infection of the sphenoid sinus from twelve of which B. influenzæ
alone or combined with pneumococci or streptococci were isolated. Lacy (74) reports four cases of influenzal sinusitis.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Acute nephritis has been reported by many observers, but the histological descriptions have been so meager that judgment
regarding it must be suspended.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. This condition has been met with more frequently in other localities. Stone and Swift (138) report it in a high percentage
of their cases. Lamb and Brannin (77) encountered it seven times, and Blanton and Irons (12) report two cases. Borst
(15) and Jaffé (66) also have found this complication.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. Cheesman and Meltzer (24) demonstrated as early as 1898 the importance of primary injury for the localization and
development of secondary infecting bacteria.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
